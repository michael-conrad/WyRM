Atop of the hill stand the ruins of what was once an abbey. Legend has it that
long ago the studious monks became corrupted by some evil and were destroyed by
a band of wizards.

As a new adventurer you have come seeking loot. Hopefully stuff that will help
with future adventures, or at least enough money to get a meal and room at a
decent inn.

You walk up the hill to the ruins.

Digging through the rumble you happen upon a flight of stairs leading down
underground.

;## up: 1b

You walk down a flight of stairs and come to a short 10ft passageway which ends
at a wall with an opening to another flight of stairs heading down into
darkness.

!player.item("torch").name="Lit torch"

You light a torch and enter the passageway turning to the right and follow the
stairs down a landing which leads straight ahead to another set of stairs going
down. You follow those stairs down and walk through a short passageway that
makes a right turn into a much longer passageway disappearing into darkness.

;## e: 1
;## n: 5
;## s: 3way
;## w: 4

You stop and listening carefully before proceeding. You only hear your own
breathing. Deciding there is nothing waiting to attack you in the darkess beyond
the reach of the torch light you continue on.

You follow the passage for 60ft and come to a four way intersection. The
passages left, straight ahead, and right disappear into darkness.

You cross the intersection and enter the passageway in front of you. You walk
for 60ft and come to an opening into a large cave.

Water oozes down the walls of this natural cave and forms a 30ft diameter pond
in the middle of it. You notice water dripping from the cave roof about 30ft
above. From the pond a rivulet of water heads into the crack which appears large
enough to walk into. The pond is covered in what appears to be a dark green

You search about the room peering into the corners and at the casks. Suddenly
one of the casks on your left shifts and you hear a moaning sound. You see a
zombie stumble into the torch light. As you prepare to fight the zombie another
cask shifts, and you see the glowing red eyes of a giant rat staring out at you.

See the two opponents, you decide to take care of the zombie first. With three
quick strikes, down, up, down it is done for and falls to the ground inert. You
lean sideways as the rat leaps toward you and put a few quick hacks into it
before it manages to leave a scratch down one of your arms. With a final chop,
you end its life.

You continue searching the room and find a very nice longbow tucked up
underneath some casks. While not directly useful, it may fetch some decent
silver at the weaponsmith's.

You find nothing else of interest.

You start poking around the casks and realize that many are busted, and the few
that aren't are empty, when a giant rat suddenly leaps out surprising you. You
manage to duck its leap and hit it using your massive attack skill, decapitating
it.

You finish search the room and find a pair of finely made boots with springy
soles inside one of the empty casks.

The skeletons take aim and loose two bolts. One bounces off harmlessly but the
second is a lucky strike and pierces your left shoulder at your armor's seem. It
doesn't go deep though and falls away leaving a shallow gash.

damage.

Swinging back with and using your massive attack talent you decapitate one of
the zombies.

FATE - 1. FATE POINTS REMAINING: 1

An arrow shot from a skeleton looks perfectly aimed to strike you in the face
when a zombie shifts in front of the bolt and blocks it from hitting you. The
zombie collapses to the floor. You rush the skeletons one by one to kill them
before they kill you.

You quickly end the two skeletal threats with one fatal strike each.

Setting the torch aside on the plinth, you pick up the two handed war axe.
Suddenly everything in the room seems brighter than before. Looking about you
notice that you can see into places where the torch light does not reach. Yes!
It's an enchanted weapon which grants dark sight!

You discover a cleverly disguised door. Opening it up you step into a 40ft x
30ft room. All the walls are covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking
acts. On the far E wall you see a mummified corpse that is tied with barbed wire
to a wooden X. There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to your
left.

; "Ring of Protection, BASE ARMOR +1" # @loot()
!room.add_item(Item("Ring of Protection, Armor +1")) #

Stepping over to the chest and peering in you see the chest is empty except for
a lone ring in one of the corners. Probably missed by whoever looted the chest
previously. Picking the ring up and examining it you see it is plainly crafted,
though of obvious high quality. You discover the etching of a shield on the
inner side of the ring.

The undead horde rushes towards you. They will surely to overwhelm you in
moments. Suddenly you find that you can't move. The undead horde has stopped
advancing and seem frozen motionless.

Before you appears a two-handed axe dripping with blood and a voice booms out:

"Ah! Entertainment! Agree to do a task for me and have a chance to live. Refuse
and you most certainly will die.  There is an amulet secreted away on a shadow
plane where locations from this reality show up in that reality.  Retrieving
this amulet then escaping the complex will result in your life being spared.
After obtaining the amulet, take it to a place of my choosing for a reward
beyond just your life."

Rushing forwards you wade into the creatures and start laying waste with your
two-handed axe. Ichor flies everywhere coating everything around you as you chop
open one beetle after another. During the melee two of the beasts get past your
guard and bite for a total of three points of damage.

Looking at the mess, you count carcasses. You killed eight giant beetles.

Casting about the room you find nothing else of interest.

You lay into the skeletons with all your might.

Using your massive attack talent you strike the closes skeleton for 9 points
and it drops unmoving to the floor. Using fancy footwork you dance about the
remaining two skeletons and deliver multiple strikes. A second skeleton drops.
You strike the last skeleton and you fail to dodge its return strike. It stabs
you for 7 points of damage. You feel the fight leave you as the axe clatters to
the floor, with you immediately following after.

You have perished.

As you continue walking up the slope you come upon the aftermatch of a
slaughter fest. You see four giant spiders wrapping in silk cocoons the unmoving
bodies of six giant rats.

They seem intent on eating the spiders, at least for the moment. A short and
very one sided battle ensues. The spiders quickly stab out with their forelegs,
each one quickly dragging a weasel within biting range, where they immediately
shove their fangs in a inject venom.

In short order the weasels are motionless. The spiders begin adding them to
their larder.

It occurs to you that the number of wandering monsters has been steadily
increasing. It might be time to get out of the complex before something bad
happens.

You step into the pond and grope around feeling along its rough bottom. When
you reach the center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can pull up on. You pull up on
the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. You toss
the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow depression with a
heavy sack in it. You drag the sack out to lie next to the pond. As you prepare
to open the sack, you notice kobolds pouring into the cave from the entrance.

You run up the stairs and rush the rats with your axe upraised.

You hit first giant rat for 6 points of damage, dodge the rat's return attack,
then hit the third rat for 10 points of damage.

The first rat gets past your defenses and hits you for 2 points of damage.

You strike the first rat again for another point of damage.

The second and fourth rats get past your defenses and hit you for a total of 4
points of damage.

You strike out and hit the first rat for 1 point of damage with a follow up
strike against the fourth rat for two points of damage. The fourth rat drops,
twitching, to the floor.

You manage to hit the third rat for one point of damage before the second rat
gets past your defenses and hits. Your health is gone. You drop as the rats
swarm over you.

You have perished.

each of your strikes. You strike the second goblin for 4 points, again for 2
points, and finally for another 2 points killing it. You continue expertly
dodging return strikes. You strike the third goblin for 2 points, again for 3

You go down a 60 ft passage and come to a natural cave. Water oozes down the
walls and forms a 30ft diameter pond in the middle of it. You notice water
dripping from the cave roof about 30ft above. From the pond a rivulet of water
heads into a large crack in the middle of the left wall which appears large
enough to walk into. The pond is covered in what appears to be a dark green
# scummy algae.

Four goblin warriors approach you with weapons at the ready. The seem to gaze
upon like you would yourself upon seeing a fantastic meal. You prepare to fight.

You strike quick and hard dealing damage two of the goblins while dodging blows
and kill a third. One goblin, hanging back, strikes between its companions
hitting you for 4 points of damage. Ouch. You finish off another goblin just
before the one hanging back manages to hit you with a death blow.

You have perished.

As you walk over to the nearest alcove to check for anything of value, the
skeleton in it suddenly rises up, its heads swivel to look in your direction,
then it starts walking towards you with a short sword clutched in its bony
fingures. From adjacent alcoves three zombies step out.

Brandeshing your axe with expert care, you step forward and strike down the
skeleton with a single stroke and on the follow through manage to hit a zombie
for 2 points of damage. It returns the favor and hits you for 3 points of
damage. Taking relish in the vanguishing you repeatably strike at the zombies
until they all collapse to the floor unmoving.

Searching the alcoves you find a finely crafted headband.

You stow the headband in your backpack before walking over to the one empty

When you examine the empty alcove, you find it is actually a cleverly hidden

Opening it up you step inside.

You step into  a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are covered with depictions of
evil and bloody looking acts. On the far E wall you see a mummified corpse that
is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X. There is a small open chest in the far
corner of the room to the NE.

!item= "Sword +1" # @item: loot()
!room.add_item(Item(item)) #

Walking over to the chest and looking inside you see a sword. Picking it up and
hefting it reveals it to be an excellent weapon. As your specialty is axes you
stow it across your back to sell later.

Searching through the rest of the room reveals nothing of interest.

You wait as they rush forwards, then lay waste to the kobolds as they enter the
shallow pond. They strike out with ineffective blows against you, as you wield
your two-handed axe like a scithe mowing down wheat. Every strike made is a
kobold dead.

Well, that didn't take long.

This place does seem to be getting busier and busier with monsters.

You dump the sack out and find a set of finely crafted chain mail. You detect
no signs of rust even though it has been submerged for an unknown period of
time.

The goblins come in swinging. Ducking, dodging, and weaving about, you strike
out four times with your axe dealing damage to four goblins doling out 7 points,
6 points, 4 points, and 5 points of damage. One of the goblins then manages to
get past your defense and hits you for 3 points of damage. Striking out twice
more in quick succession you kill two of the goblins.

Just as another goblin comes in with what looks like a killing blow, one of
their group stumbles and knocks the strike off target. It missings you entirely.

There are five goblins arrayed against you. Two goblins lie dead on the floor.

You step into the crack then start walking upslope. About 10ft in you see the

FATE - 1. NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

; Opposing forces attack each other or hurt themselves with own weapons. Player
; gets an automatic flee success check.  Opponents will attack player next round.

It turns into a slug fest of epic proportions. Ducking, dodging, and weaving
through the ever growing horde of skeletons and zombies you manage to kill three
skeletons and six zombies before being reduced to 1 point of health.

You rush by the weasels in such a hurry that you leave them looking stunned in
your wake.

You come to an open portcullis leading into a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves in
the walls. You notice the alcoves are filled with the skeletons and corpses of
monks. Though the biggest attention getter is the pack of worgs munching bones
in the alcoves. As a group, they turn to face you. In there eyes you can see
them thinking, "Fresh Meat!"

You are seriously injured and have no mana.

As you rush through the intersection going as fast as you can, you here a storm
of squeaks coming from the passage to your right. Glancing that way as you pass,
you see a wall of red glittering eyes heading your way.

Rushing down 100ft of tunnel you come to the stairwell leading to the surface.
Taking the steps two and three at a time you make it back to the surface and
hurry back to town.

You have successfully made it out alive to tell the tale.

After reaching town, you rest and heal overnight.

The next day you go visit the merchents to see what loot you have gained.

Taking advantage of the situtation you grab the axe, setting down your torch

Seeing the need for escape,you rush down 100ft of passage and reach the
stairwell leading out of the complex.

Heading up, you return to the ruins of the abbey.

You return to town and spend some time healing and resting.

The next day you go visiting various shops to see what you have collected.

Well, that sucks, only one of the three items will be worth any decent amount

Using your massive attack talent you strike the first spider for 7 points of
damage. Two spiders strike you with their forelegs causing a total of 9 points
of damage. You next successful strike is a bit weak only causing 1 point of
damage. One of the spiders looks perfectly poised to end you in a single bite
when its legs slip out from under it, causing it to fall into the other two
spiders. They stop attacking you and start hissing at each other.

FATE - 1. FATE POINTS REMAINING: 1

; Opposing forces attack each other or hurt themselves with own weapons. Player
; gets an automatic flee success check.  Opponents will attack player next round.

You hit the first skeleton for 7 points of damage. Avoiding return strikes you
hit a zombie for 11 points of damage. Dodging another set of strikes, you hit
the first skeleton a second time for 2 points of damage and it drops. As the
skeleton falls, a zombie gets past your defenses and hits you for 3 points of
damage, leaving you only 3 health left. Swinging you axe back around you hit the
second skeleton for a measly 1 point of damage when the zombie reaches in and
bites into your throat. Everything goes dark.

You are now a zombie.

strike out again and again, chipping carapaces and cracking shells letting ichor
to ooze out. It takes seventeen blows but you slaughter them all. You only get
bit twice, for a total of 6 points of damage.

You strike the first zombie with your axe for 5 points of damage. The second
zombie tears into you clased hands and takes 5 points of health from you. You
strike out again and hit the third zombie for two quick strikes in success but
only manage to deal 3 points of damage. The first zombie reaches out and pulls
you in for a massive neck bite. You blood sprayes everywhere.

You have perished.

spider for 10 points of damage with a followup in the second spider for 2 pionts
of damage. Expertly dodging their forelimb strikes and fangs, you strike the
first spider twice for 5 points of damage, killing it. With a flourish you smash
the blade of your axe into the remaining spider for 7 points of damage, cracking
it open. It dies.

Using your massive attack talent, you hit the first spider for 14 points of
damage, but it keeps on fighting. Dodging blows, you hit two of the spiders for
a total of 5 points. One of the spiders gets past your defense and stabs you
with a forelimb for 6 points of damage. You return with a weak strike only
dealing 1 point of damage. A spider which had been hanging back, leaps forward,
with the intent of finishing you.

You make short work of the rats, hacking and slashing them all with brutal
efficiency. One of the buggers got you for four points of damage though.

You continue upslope and come to an opening. Peering out, you see the hillside
with the ruins of the abbey just above you.

;## in front of you [S]: 4b

Stowing the belt away quietly in your backpack, you sneak back into the crack
and follow it upslope till you exit the complex.

You spend a well deserved night resting and healing.

The next day you go and visit the local merchants to see what things of value
you may have acquired.

Taking advantage of the quiet passage, you cast Healing Hand.

Exhausting your mana, you regain 5 points of health.

You make short work of the annoying creatures. You strike the first one dead in

You continue down the passage and travel 100ft before coming to the stairs
heading up. You climb the stairs and head back to town.

You take a night resting and healing.

The next day you go merchent visiting to discover if anything you found is of

You pull a fancy looking belt out of the sack and put it on.

You watch the spiders and worgs battle it out. It does not go well for the
worgs. Finally two giant spiders remain. Now is the time to attack!

One of the spiders manages to hit before you fully get into ready position and
does a massive 7 points of damage. You return the favor by striking multiple
times against both creatures while dodging and weaving multiple attacks. -6, -2,
-1, -1, -7. One of the spiders collapses to the floor. Only one spider left. You
continue to evade attacks while dealing damage. You deal 6 points in a flurry of
strikes before the spider gets past your defenses and strikes you with a
forelimb for 1 point of damage.

FATE - 1. NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

; Magical Scythe Blades appear then vanish. 4d10 dmg. (16)

You hear a click from the floor and suddenly see the flash of silvery metal as
ghostly scythe blades appear sweeping back and forth before vanishing into
nothingness.

!dmg= 17 # @dmg: roll("4d10")
!room.npc("#6").hp= -16 # @room.npc("#6").hp: room.npc("#6").hp - dmg

The last spider bursts splashing ichor everywhere. Its pieces fall unmoving to
the floor.

You are gravely wounded and take a moment to cast Healing Hand.

;;; !Macro.heal()

!cast= False # @cast: 'succeeded' in str(player.cast('Healing Hand')).lower()
!player.mana= 2 # @player.mana: player.mana
!hp= 0 # @hp: roll('1d6') if cast else 0
!player.hp= 3 # @player.hp: player.hp + hp

;;; !Macro.heal()

!cast= True # @cast: 'succeeded' in str(player.cast('Healing Hand')).lower()
!player.mana= 1 # @player.mana: player.mana
!hp= 6 # @hp: roll('1d6') if cast else 0
!player.hp= 9 # @player.hp: player.hp + hp

;;; !Macro.heal()

!cast= True # @cast: 'succeeded' in str(player.cast('Healing Hand')).lower()
!player.mana= 0 # @player.mana: player.mana
!hp= 6 # @hp: roll('1d6') if cast else 0
!player.hp= 15 # @player.hp: player.hp + hp

It takes three casts and the exhaustion of your mana, but you heal yourself
back to full strenth.

Searching about, you find nothing else of interest.

You lay into the undead horde hacking and slashing everywhere you can to end
the threat. You quickly vanquish two of the three skeletons and then start into
the zombies. After much hacking one of the zombies drops allowing you to get
another strike into the last skeleton. As you do so, one of the zombies manages
to reach in with its clawed hands piercing your armor. -2 HP. You continue
waving your axe about in a frantic way and shortly two more zombies drop to the
floor unmoving. Another of the zombies gets past your defense and pierces your
armor. -4 HP. You finish off the remaining undead with two strikes against the
last zombie and one final hit against the last skeleton.

Looking about you see three dead skeleton warriors and four dead zombies.

You are badly injured.

!room.add_item(Item("Keoghtom's Ointment, heals 2d8+2")) #
!room.item("Keoghtom's Ointment").uses = 3

Quickly searching the bodies and alcoves you find a tin of salve in one of the
zombie pockets. Opening it up and looking inside you see what looks like 3 doses
left of what might be a healing salve.

You take a dose of the salve and apply it to your wounds. You feel a warm
tingling sensation.

You watch in amazement as your wounds all close up and disappear. You have been

You quickly pocket the remaining salve in your front right pocket for use
later.

value.

You go down 100ft and come to a bend in the passage leading to the stairwell.
Heding up the stairwell, you exit the complex into the ruins of the abbey then
pick way down hill and head back to town.

You have good night of rest and healing.

The next day you visit various merchents see what things of value you have
found.

Only one good item to sell. And something cursed. Yikes!

Thinking about it, you realize there was probably a lot more to find there
beneath the ruins of the abbey.

You rush in to do battle.

You are bit by a zombie. -2 HP. You strike down a zombie. -8 HP. You leave a
long gash in another. -6 HP. One of the skeletons gets past your defense and
stabs you. -5 HP. You strike the two remaing zombies again. -4 HP. -3 HP. One of
them successfully retaliates for a clawed hand strike. -3 HP.

Girding your self as you weaken you continue dealing blow after blow. You drop
two more zombies. -4 HP. -1 HP. -1 HP.

Swinging your axe around you deal fatal damage to one of the skeleton warriors.
-9 HP. On your return swing you hit another zombie causing it to fall. -1 HP.

Only the one skeleton left.

You quickly dispatch it with two well placed strikes. -5 HP. -4 HP.

Taking stock, you realize that you are now gravely wounded.

You look the axe over:

!player.weapon.description # 
;## Axe (Dark Enchanted) (+1/+1). Two-handed.

;## The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting edges.
;## The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark blood red arcane symbols.
;## The top of the hand grip has a circle of dark blood red leather as does the bottom of the hand grip.
;## From the edge of the hasp dangles a dark blood red leather strip loop.
;## Attack Bonus: +1, Damage Bonus: +1, Grants dark sight 60ft.
;## The blade edges become wreathed in flame when attacking. The +1 effects are from the flames. 
;## 
The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting
edges. The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark
blood red arcane symbols. The top of the hand grip has a circle of dark blood
red leather as does the bottom of the hand grip. From the edge of the hasp
dangles a dark blood red leather strip loop.

Looking about the room for anything else of interest you realize the torch as
sputter out but that you can see better than before. Ah! The axe grants
darkvision! Fantastic!

Looking about there is nothing else other than the bodies of the undead and the
stone plinth.

Taking advantage of the lull in fighting you walk over to the empty alcove and
see that it is a cleverly disguised door.

Before doing anything else, you search the bodies and find a nicely crafted
plainly banded ring on one of the zombies. You retrieve the ring.

You dance among the skeletons managing to dodge most of their attacks with a
swiftness and grace you have never felt before. It must be the cloak imparting
some type of magical evasion skill to you. Fifteen strikes later and all of the
skeletons have been vanquished. Only one got a luck strike in for a single point
of damage.

You are badly wounded.

Taking advantage of not being under attack you cast Healing Hand.

a stone plinth on the far side holding both a two-handed war axe and a two-
handed warhammer. Even from this distance you can tell that they are finely
crafted weapons. Next to the plinth on the floor you see the remains of a monk

Feeling much better after the healing, you rush back into the cave to finish
off the undead skeletons.

They seem to have forgotten about you as you surpise them and attack before
they can sort themselves out.

-5 HP, -1 HP, -4 HP, -4 HP, -1 HP, -4 HP. A skeleton drops. -1 HP, -6 HP.
Another skeleton drops. -1 HP, -3 HP, -1 HP, -2 HP, -3 HP. A third skeleton
drops. -4 HP, -1 HP. Then a fourth one drops just as you are stabbed through the
thigh by the last skeleton. -2 HP. You finish it off with two swipes of the axe.
-2 HP, -2 HP.

You have defeated the skeletons, though not unscathed, you are injured and are
out of mana.

You duck through the opening and rush down a 100ft long passageway. Coming on a
flight of stairs to your left, you quickly turn and rush up three flights of
stairs and emerge in the ruins of the abbey.

Wasting no time you head back to town for healing and rest.

Ducking, dodging, and weaving to the best of your ability, you manage three
quick strikes that result in two fatalities. -6 HP, -8 HP, -8 HP. Some more
fancy defensive footwork and you strike out against two more of the hobgoblins,
dropping another to the floor. -2 HP, -3 HP. You continue to press your attack
on the remaining hobgoblins dealing blow after blow. -6 HP, -7 HP, -5 HP, -1 HP,
-2 HP.

You have vanquished all of the hobgoblins! It must be this fancy new chain mail
armor!

Searching about you find nothing of interest until you come to the end of the

You enter a very large crack in the cave wall and go about 30 ft and notice the
ground starting to slope upwards.

Poking around you find nothing of interestin the tunnel. You continue to follow
it and come to an opening. Stepping through you find that you are on the
hillside below the ruins of the abbey. You have found another way in and out of
the complex.

You are injured and decide it would be a good idea to heal yourself.

The second cast is a success and you regain 3 HP and are now almost fully
healed.

The kobolds surround the spider and begin attacking it from all sides. The
spider is fast and stabs out into the kobolds with its forelimbs dealing damage
to several combatants. -3 HP, -6 HP, -3 HP. The kobolds make a concerted effort
and drive their swords deep into the spiders main body. -14 HP. It drops
twitching to the floor.

They turn and look at you. Brandishing your axe way up high, you rush in to do
combat.

through your gut. -5 HP. You collapse gasping. Everything goes dark.

You make it back to the 4-way intersection without incident.

You are badly injured.

Taking advantage of the alone time, you quickly cast Healing Hand on yourself
to recover.

should have helped.

The kobolds surround their target. The spider quickly lashes out with forelimb
attacks and bites. -7 HP, -5 HP, -1 HP. One of the kobolds goes down under the
onslaught. -1 HP, -1 HP, -4 HP. Another kobold falls. -5 HP, -4 HP. Only two
kobolds left fighting now. -3 HP. Now only one. -3 HP. And now that one is down
too. Not a single strike by the kobolds seems to have hurt the spider. It turns
and rushes you.

head three times rapidly. -1 HP, -1 HP, -1 HP. It bites down harder, injecting a
load of venom into you. -8 HP. Swinging you axe desperately you chop into one of
its fangs. -2 HP. It scrabbles trying to pull you in closer and bites down
again. -1 HP. You deal a blow from your axe that causes a crack to form down the

You follow the passage for 50ft and come to a cave with a tiled floor. You see
a stone plinth on the far side holding a two handed war axe. Even from this
distance you can tell that it is a finely crafted weapon. Next to the plinth on
the floor you see the remains of a monk with several arrows in its back. It
looks like the monk was trying to reach the axe before being struck down. As you

The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting
edges. The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark
blood red arcane symbols. The top of the hand grip has a circle of dark blood
red leather as does the bottom of the hand grip. From the edge of the hasp
dangles a dark blood red leather strip loop.

One of the pieces of legendary gear?

As you hold it, you notice that you can now see into the shadows in the corners
of the room cast by the torch light. Fantastic! It grants darkvision!

You discard the torch, stow the one-handed axe, then equip yourself with the
two-handed axe.

You follow the passage for 50ft and come to a cave with a tiled floor. You see
a stone plinth on the far side holding a two handed war axe. Even from this
distance you can tell that it is a finely crafted weapon. Next to the plinth on
the floor you see the remains of a monk with several arrows in its back. It
looks like the monk was trying to reach the axe before being struck down. As you
look beyond the dead monk you see figures moving into the torchlight.

Three skeleton warriors and a zombie come into view.

a stone plinth on the far side holding a two handed war axe. Even from this
distance you can tell that it is a finely crafted weapon. Next to the plinth on
the floor you see the remains of a monk with several arrows in its back. It

You see three skeleton warriors and one zombie.

grope around under it and find a medium sack.

Emptying the sack out you find a ring and a set of gauntlets. The ring has a
picture of a shield engraved on its inner ring. The guantlets are nicely
decorated and each one has an engraving of a fist.

You suddenly hear hissing coming from the doorway out of the cave. Looking over
quickly you see a giant spider approaching. Deciding you need all the help you
can get, and hoping for the best, you equip the gauntlets and put on the ring.

skeleton warriors entering the cave just behind you.

The skeletons jostle into each other in their zeal to strike you down and

are fighting over you!

You see one of the skeletons strike chipping bone off the other. The second
retaliates by crushing the head of the first skeleton with the pommel of its
sword. The first skeleton drops into a heap of bones on the floor. The second
skeleton advances.

The walls of this natural cave are wet and you see water dripping from above
into the pond. From the pond a rivulet of water heads into the crack in the far
wall.

You pull up on the ledge and fish a metal plate out of the water. Feeling

As you start sneaking past the spiders you notice figures walking into the room

Using your massive attack talent, you hit the first skeleton and its head goes
flying across the room. You strike the last skeleton and manage to break its
spine. It drops.

Now that everything here is dead, you open the sack and pull out a tin of what
looks like ointment or salve. A healing salve? Looks like a bit over half has
been used already.

You put the tin in your front left pocket. Who knows, maybe it will become
handy.

Not seeing any other opponents, you continue following the passage till you
come to an exit leaving the complex.

You have found a second way into and out of the complex.

Searching about, you find nothing of interest.

You grope around in the pond feeling along its rough bottom. When you reach the

little more you find an edge you can probably pull up on.

with a bang.

You step into the room and notice that there is movement in several of the
alcoves!

With mounting horror you realize you've entered a crypt and it seems to be full
of the undead! If you turn to flee you know they will quickly catch up and
overwhelm you. Better to stand and fight at the entrace. Keep how many can
attack you at once down to one at a time.

You stand valiantly against the onslaught, dealing out damage left and right in
a whirlwind of axe strikes.

Using your massive attack talent, you strike the first skeleton for 9 points
flinging it back against the wall where it collapses into a disjoint pile of
bones and rusty armor.

You swipe the first zombie twice, cutting deeply into its chest. I crumples
into a heap on the floor.

The remaining zombies crowd in a against you, you manage to strike into the
mass of stinking flesh and deal 6 points of damage against the first zombie, 2
points of damage against another another with a double strike, and 11 points
against the third.

The first zombie rakes its clawed hands across your chest getting past your
armor and dealing 2 points of damage.

You strike back it at for 1 point of damage and follow through with a
successful strike against another of the things. It drops.

Two zombies and one skeleton warrior to go!

One of the zombies reaches in and manages to bite you with its stinking maw for
8 points of damage. Ouch, that hurt!

While strike it for 2 points of damage in retaliation the skeletons finally
reach you and stab in with their rusty short swords piercing you armor and
striking you down.

You realize this is your opportunity to get past the monstrous beasts and back

grasp. You toss the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow
depression with a sack in it.

; "Bag of Holding" # @loot()
!player.equipment.append(Item("Bag of Holding", "belt"))

Opening the sack up you find a black felt bag. Examining it closely you see
that it is finely made. You've seen bags similar to this in magic shops, their
insides are bigger than their outsides.

You put the bag on your belt. It will work better than the backpack for
stashing loot.

Looking about you see nothing else of interest.

You perform a majestic three strike combo hitting the zombie, a skeleton, and a
rat all in quick succession. Unfortunately for you the zombie reaches in and
manages to latch on and pulls itself onto you and proceeds to starting biting.
Before you can dislodge the awful thing you feel the thrust of a sword from
behind into your back from one of the skeletons. Everything goes dark.

You have perished.

You start going from alcove to alcove check the skeletons and corpses for any

warrior skeleton walking towards you and two shambling zombies following.
Blocked in, you have no choice but to fight it out.

Rushing forward you use your massive attack talent and destroy the skeleton in
one blow. You follow that up with two quick strikes on the first zombie,
severing its head and killing it. Swinging back around you slice a long gash
across the second zombie's chest dealing 4 points of damage.

You finish looting the alcoves and find a potion and two rings.

Examining the potion you see it has the picture of wings on it.

The first ring has depictions of snowflakes artfully engraved over its entire
circumfrence.

The second ring has a picture of a shield engraved on its inside but is
otherwise plain.

glint from the floor. Looking down you see a ring that you didn't notice as you
entered the room. Picking it up and polishing it off some reveals a finely
crafted silver ring. It is plain except for the engraving of a shield on the
inner band. You put the ring on with your other rings. You are now wearing three

The spider lunges at you and you dodge its strike. Using your massive attack
talent you hit it for 15 points of damage following up with another quick chop
for 2 more points of damage.

The spider gets past your defenses and leaves a gash on your left forearm. You
strike back for 1 point of damage. The spider again bites into you for 1 point
of damage.

Finally you get another good swing in and kill the spider with 6 points of

You can't move.

Before you appears a two-handed axe dripping with blood and a voice booms out:

"Ah! Entertainment! Agree to do a task for me and have a chance to live. Refuse
and you most certainly will die. There is an amulet secreted away on a shadow
plane where locations from this reality show up in that reality. Retrieving this
amulet then escaping the complex will result in your life being spared. After
obtaining the amulet, take it to a place of my choosing for a reward beyond just
your life."

The axe floating before you suddenly swipes out at the undead from several feet
away. The skeletons suddenly shatter into fragments and the zombie becomes
dismembered body parts in a heap on the floor.

In the doorway you see where a giant beetle covered in gashes with ichor
leaking everywhere.

knocking it back across the room, double swipe the second rat, punish the first
rat with a decapitation when it comes back for more, then finally break the back
of the surviving rat.

You enter a very large crack in the cave wall and go about 30 ft and notice the
ground starting to slope upwards. Out of the darkness in front of you leaps a
giant spider.

FATE - 1. NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

As it leaps forward to sink its fangs into your tastyness you hear a loud crack
from above and see a stalactite come crashing down hitting the spider for 5
points of damage.

Your hope that the stalactite had done enough damage to make the spider be easy
pickings comes to naught. With two quick jabs of its fangs, it injects enough
venom in for you to instantly black out.

You are spider fodder.

You begin to search the cave and around the pond. Suddenly you hear a hissing
noise from the entrance. Looking back you see a giant beetle stalking towards
you.

Rushing forwards you swing you attack down in a massive attack and strike
before the beetle can react. A quick second strike and it ceases moving.

!room.notes += " dead beetle near entrance."

You continue searching but find nothing of interest.

The floating axe vanishes and suddenly everything is moving again!

You strike out and hit a skeleton for 7 points of damage. Another skeleton hits
you for 4 points of damage. You get four strikes in while dodging stabs and
zombie claws. One of the skeletons drops to the floor. Unfortunately, the zombie
gets past your defense and sinks its teeth into your neck.

You have become a zombie.

You go ahead and stow the bag, wand, and mace. These seem the least likely
usable items at the moment.

!player.equipment.append(room.pop_item('bag').set_location("backpack"))
!player.equipment.append(room.pop_item('wand').set_location("backpack"))
!player.equipment.append(room.pop_item('mace').set_location("backpack"))

This leaves the amulet, gauntlets, ring, and armor to decide about.

You enter the rather wide and tall crack in the side of the cave and go about
10ft when you hear a hissing noise from behind. Quickly turning ready to smash
anything with your axe, you see two giant spider stalking you. They are blocking
your way out.

Then the battle is on and just as quick it is over.

They jump at you sinking their fangs into your tasty flesh. You struggle to
fend of its attacks and hit it with your axe, but to no avail. They get to
injecting you with venom leaving gaping wounds behind each attack.

You perish.

You rush forwards hoping to squash the spider in one massive blow! You strike,
and with a horrible crack, a seam opens up in the beasts carapace. It retaliates
by grabbing and holding you in place as it injects you with more than enough
venom to kill you. As things beging fading to black, you see two more giant
spiders coming up the stairs.

You are spider fodder.

You step into a 90ft x 40ft room full of wine and ale casks, many of which
appear busted open. You don't see any doors or passages in the room.

You start searching the room to see if any loot might be found in or under the
casks. Suddenly some casks that you were getting ready to search through shift
and four giant rats rush out to attack.

The battle is on!

The third giant rat attacking hits you for 1 point damage. You strike back
hitting the 2nd and 4th rats, each for 8 points of damage. You swing back around
and strike the 4th rat for 4 points of damage, killing it.

The third rat scratches you for a single point of damage. You strike the first
rat with two quick axe chops for 8 and 4 points of damage. It drops dead.

The third rat gets a bite in. In retaliation you strike it twice, one for 2
points of damage, and a second time for 10 points of damage. It expires.

You take a final swing hitting the last giant rat for 4 points of damage ending
it.

After digging around you find a pair of goggles.

Examining them closely you notice that when looking through the lenses, all the
darkness cast by the torch light disappears allowing you to see clearly.

You rush in to attack. The undead take whacks at you before you can land any
hits, but only one manages a lucky strike. A skeleton warrior hits you for 4
points of damage. Using your massive attack talent you strike a skeleton lopping
its head off. It collapses. You strike the next two skeletons gradually wearing
them down. Then the zombie gets into range and you whack it, leaving a gash
across its chest. Two of the skeletons work their way in front of the zombie,
but miss with their jabs. You lash out twice, doing some serious damage to the
first one and ending the animation of the second one. This leaves an opening for
the zombie which attacks again, but you fend off its claws easily. You strike it
down and put a final hit into the last warrior skeleton.

You walk over and pick up the axe, setting the torch to one side on the plinth,
and heft it. It has a very nice feel and seems to thrum slightly.

You realize that you aren't seeing the room in dark shadows anymore. Yes! The
axe grants magical sight!

You stow your old axe and equip the new two handed beast.

You search the rest of the room but find nothing of interest.

As you attempt to slide past the hungry creature it leaps at you definitely
intending to skewer you with its fangs, but several rocks shift under its weight
as it pounces causing it to miss you entirely. You make it back out into the
cave.

You can hear the spider hissing and spitting behind you as it gives chase. You
rush out out of the cave and down the long passageway and come to the four way
intersection.

You head down the long passage heading toward the stairs which go back up to
the surface. You stop and listen carefully. You don't hear any sign of pursuit.

You rush down the stairs and enter a 90ft x 40ft room. You see casks and cask
pieces against the far wall. You hear the spider following along behind you.

Suddenly a giant rat busts out of the casks to your left and 3 skeleton
warriors raise up off the floor to your right!

You are boxed in good!

FATE - 1. NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

You see the spider crawl in going down the stairs when it knocks a small pebble
skittering down the steps. This immediately attracts the attention of the rat
which attacks. Good, maybe they'll kill each other while you try and finish off
the skeletons.

The spider does not give the rat a chance to strike, quickly sinking its fangs
into the rat's side. The spider picks up the corpse of the rat and proceeds
heading back up stairs.

The skeletons approach and before you know it you are in combat with the
undead. Each skeleton takes turns swinging at you. You fail to dodge two of
their strikes.

You have perished.

You rush down the passageway to your left and come to a portcullis. You pull it
open with a horrible screeching noise then slam it back closed behind you as you
enter the room. Quickly examining the portcullis you don't see any way to bar it
closed so you duck to one side out of sight of the passageway. Listening
carefully you don't hear any sounds of pursuit. You've escaped.

You are in a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves in all the walls. From the center of

skeletons and corpses of monks, except one. Which is to the far right of the

First you look at the boots. They are finely made and covered with a soft black
felt. The soles seem like they would make walking and running quieter.

The gauntlets are a bronze with pictures of a person's bicep with lightning
bolts leaping out. They have an extra special thrum about them.

You heft the axe. A one handed weapon it looks expertly made with a very
serious looking edge. It seems extra special.

Using your massive attack talent you strike out and hit a zombie for 10 points
of damage leaving a wide open gash across its chest. Another zombie gets past
your defense and rakes its clawed hands across one of your arms for 1 point of
damage. You return blows and hit two zombies for 3 points each of damage, then
strike a third decapitating it. It falls. One of zombies rakes it claws past
your defense and cause 1 point of damage to your left leg. You hear a buzzing
noise. You retaliate hitting it for 3 points of damage. Another zombie manages
to get its maw in to bite you across the left arm for 4 points of damage.
Everything is suddenly cast in a greenish hue as you hear a voice from above
saying, "Throw it into the portal you fool!" Your return attacks opens the chest
of one zombie which collapses to the floor and leaves a 2 point gash in another.
You hear a snap, the green hue vanishes, and you see a small crackling ball of
lightning fall and hit one of the zombies. It explodes scattering gore
everywhere.

You step into the pond and grope around feeling along its rough bottom. When
you reach the center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can pull up on. You pull up on
the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. You toss
the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow depression with a
sack in it.

Suddenly you hear hissing from the entrance. Turning, you see two giant spiders
rushing in to attack.

Regardless of their bumbling, they get their act together and get past your

You discover the empty alcove is actually a cleverly disguised door!

Opening it up and stepping in you find your self in a 40ft x 30ft room. All the
walls are covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far E
wall you see a mummified corpse that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X.
There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to the NE.

; "Potion of Flying" # @loot()
!potion=Item("Potion of Flying", location)

Walking over to the chest you find it is empty except for a lone potion vial.
Looking at it closely you see a picture of angelic wings engraved into the
glass.

Stashing the potion in your backpack, your search of the rest of the room
reveals nothing of interest.

distance you can tell that it is a finely crafted weapon.

Next to the plinth on the floor you see the remains of a monk with several

As you look beyond the dead monk you see figures moving into the torchlight.
Three warrior skeletons approach with swords up and shields at the ready.

The skeletons take swings at you but you dock, dodge, and weave through their
sword strikes dealing damage as you go. You strike the first skeleton with your
massive attack skill across its skull which shatters. You strike the second
skeleton with to hacking slashes and deal 7 points of damage. The second
skeleton strikes back and hits you for 1 point of damage. You swing your axe
around and hit the third skeleton for 1 point of damage. The second skeleton
makes another successful strike and hits you for 1 point of damage. Swinging
your axe back around in a wide arc you shatter the skulls of the two remaining
skeletons.

HIT POINTS REMAINING: 9

You walk over, pickup, and examine the axe.

The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting
edges. The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark
blood red arcane symbols. The top of the handgrap has a circle of dark blood red
leather as does the bottom of the handgrip. From the edge of the hasp dangles a
dark blood red leather strip loop.

You feel a sense of malice eminating off of the axe, though it doesn't seem
directed at you.

Carefully setting your torch down on the plinth so not as to let it go out, you
heft the two-handed battle axe and test its weight and balance.

You suddenly notice something odd. All the shadows in the room seem to have
receded away from you. As you look about you see that the torch is still casting
shadows, but you can now see into them.

As a test you extinguish the torch and realize you can still see perfectly
fine! Setting the axe down on the plinth, you wait to see how long the effect
lasts. While there is a noticible immediate darkening of the room, the ability
seems to last quite a while. This seems handy, no torch required! You decide to
pick the axe back up and use it.

pull you close and start munching. You aren't having any of that! You hack the
first zombie three times and watch it fall then immediately wail on the second
zombie with multiple axe slashes till it too also falls. Quickly searching the
corpses you find nothing of value.

Turning around you rush into battle. Using your massive attack talent you hit
the first giant rat and watch is it cleaves into two halves. A second rat
manages to bite for 4 points of damage. You kill the third rat with a single
blow. Swinging back around you chop the second rat two more times before it
collapses, dead.

slashing with your axe. It turns into a slug fest as you hack and hack and hack.

and you most certainly will die. There is an amulet secreted away on a shadow
plane where locations from this reality show up in that reality. Retrieving this
amulet then escaping the complex will result in your life being spared. After

Using your massive attack talent, you strike the first rat for 11 points and
leave a deep gouge in its side. Your next swing damages the third rat for 6
points along its face. The first rat rakes at you with its claws for 1 point of
damage. You dodge more attacks then swing hitting the third rat for 5 points
with a follow up chop that ends its life. Unfortunately, the 2nd rat takes
advantage of your occupation with the third rat and grapples you from behind,
toppling you. You quickly succumb to the onslaught of teeth and claws.

You have perished.

The rats in their zeal to get at the free meal that was just delivered to their

themselves and move to attack you again.

Using your massive attack talent you strike the first rat dead in a single
blow. The third rat latches onto your leg dealing 5 points of damage. Hindered
by the creature, the second rat reaches up and tears out your throat.

Losing its last shot, it rushes forward attacking with its bow like a club! The
arrow strikes for 1 point of damage. The skeleton then follows up with a strike
using the bow for 3 points of damage and smashes your skull in.

skeleton and tears into you with its teeth and clawed hands.

You perish.

You step into a natural cave. Water oozes down the walls and forms a 30ft
diameter pond in the middle. You notice water dripping from the cave roof about
30ft above. From the pond a rivulet of water heads into a crack to your left
which appears large enough to walk into. The pond is covered in what appears to
be a dark green scummy algae. But what captures your attention the most is the
fight happening between two hungry giant spiders and a giant beetle who appears
about to become dinner.

;;; !beetle1.run_combat4([spider1, spider2])

; NPC party has initiative
; Giant Spider (#21) hits Giant Beetle (#3) for 5 points of damage
; Giant Spider (#21) hits for 9 points and kills Giant Beetle (#3)

!spider2.name += f" (Room 4a, eating, will come out again after turn {turn+5})"

Both spiders quickly move in striking with their fangs injecting loads of venom
into the beetle. The beetle struggles to keep defending itself but quickly slows
then becomes still. As you stand there quietly, the spiders drag their dinner
into the large crack in the left wall and disappear into darkness.

You feel much better.

The passage across the intersection leads to the surface and is where you
entered the complex.

It takes two casts and depletion of your mana reserves, but you are back at
full strength.

You step into the pond and grope around feeling along its rough bottom. When
you reach the center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can pull up on. You pull up on

it you see the picture of a human heart.

You follow the passage for 50ft and come to a cave with a tiled floor. You see
a stone plinth on the far side holding a two handed war axe. Even from this
distance you can tell that it is a finely crafted weapon. Next to the plinth on
the floor you see the remains of a monk with several arrows in its back. It
looks like the monk was trying to reach the axe before being struck down. As you
look beyond the dead monk you see figures moving into the torchlight and hear
the spider coming up from behind.

You realize this is not a good situtation as the figures resolve to be 3
skeleton warriors and a zombie. The only thing left to do is fight and hope!

Looking up, you see the spider crawling across the ceiling preparing to land on
you when suddenly a section of roof gives way and it falls. Much to your horror,
you see it crash into two other giant spiders that were crawling down the
passage after you!

Unfortunately it does not look like the fall did it or its friends any harm.

They swarm over you and quickly take your life.

You have perished.

You come back to the portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves
in the walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here. You push the portcullis
open with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step into the room. You can
now see into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and
corpses of monks, except one. Which is in the right wall in the near corner.

Opening the door and entering, you see a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are
covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far wall you see
a mummmified corpose that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X.

There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to your left.

Finally! Loot!

You walk over and examine the items in the chest.

!room.add_item(tin)
!room.add_item(ring)
!room.add_item(wand)

You find a tin, a ring, and a wand.

Opening the tin you see a salve, partly used. A healing ointment maybe?

The ring is a plain silver band with a picture of a shield on the inner band.

The wand looks like willow wood and has a single glowing sliver of a blue gem
at its base.

You rush forwards into battle. You strike two of the zombies for 8 points and 2
points of damage.

The zombies return your attack but their attacks tangle with each other and
they don't make contact.

You again strike out hitting two of the zombies for a total of 12 points of

showing rotting teeth ready to chown down on your flesh when a skeleton's sword
pierces it through the chest throwing its attack way off.

Taking advantage of their confused attack, you strike the skeleton warrior,
crushing its chest, sending it toppling backwards into a heap. You hit the
zombie that was stabbed by the skeleton and it falls unmoving. You start hacking
and slashing into the remaining zombies and skeleton and chop them into heaps on
the floor.

Three zombies and two skeletons lie on the floor in various states of severe
damage.

Suddenly a giant spider rushes you from ahead.

A mighty struggle ensues between you and hungry monster. The spider leaps at
you and you dodge. You quickly hammer in two axe chops for 11 points and 4
points of damage. The spider retaliates striking you with one of its legs for 2
points of damage. Again you strike two times for a total of 8 points of damage.
The spider looks weakened, but it still has fight as it slashes at you again
with a leg and causes another 2 points of damage. With a final swing of the axe,
you terminate the beast.

!room.notes="1 dead spider"

You continue following the passage and come to an opening to the outside. You
have found another way in and out of the complex.

You still have loot to seek.

Casting Healing Hand twice you regain full health.

You decide this really sucks! All this running around and no loot yet! You
decide to try harder to get something!

You head back to the four way intersection.

You are in the cave with pond in the middle. There is a large crack in wall to
your left.

Peering inside the cave you see nothing moving, so you proceed to search the
pond.

Feeling around in the pond you come to a smooth spot with an edge, like a
board. You pull up on the edge and fish out a metal plate. Feeling around where
the plate was you find a depression with a sack.

You pull the sack free, step out of the pond, and dump its contents onto the
floor for perusal.

!loot_qty= 1 # @loot_qty: roll("1d2")

The only thing that falls out besides a little mud is a potion vial. Examining
it you see that there is a picture of a closed on on the vial. You stash it in
your backpack.

!player.equipment.append(Item("Potion of Invisibility", "backpack"))

Further searching reveals nothing of interest.

You stand in the doorway to keep them fighting you one at a time.

The zombies reach you first. Using your massive attack talent, you decapitate
the first zombie. The second zombie rakes its clawed hands at your armor,
getting through in one spot for 3 points of damage. You strike it back, hacking
deeply into its chest for 5 points of damage. It returns the favor and rakes you
for another 5 points of damage. You strike it once more, but only cause 1 point
of damage. It grabs you, pulls you close, and clamps its teeth about your neck.
Blood splashes everywhere as your life drains away.

You have perished and become a zombie.

You come to an open portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves

of monks.

In the middle of the room, rushing towards you, is a very familiar looking
giant spider!

As you watch in mounting horror, you see three skeletons and a zombie suddenly
rise up out of the alcoves and rush towards you with the spider!

Oh! Wait! Fate is being kind! They are attacking the spider!

Unfortunately, the spider obliterates the undead with its forelegs. In a blur
of motion you see it strike out shattering the skeletons one after the other
then it finally impales the zombie and flings it away.

Barely a scratch! Not one of the undead did any significant damage to the
monster!

It looks annoyed.

You pull up on the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your
grasp. You toss the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow
depression with a sack in it. As you prepare to open the sack to see what you
have found, you hear hissing from above quickly followed by two thuds from the
entrance.

You enter a very large crack in the cave wall and go about 30 ft and notice the
ground starting to slope upwards. Suddenly you hear hissing from in front and
from behind. Waving you torch about you see two giant spiders come into view
from in front of you and one giant spider come into view behind you. You are
trapped!

The other two spiders seem to get tired of the first spiders ineffective
attacks and pile in shoving their fangs into your body deeply injecting you with
loads of venom.

You have become spider fodder.

You hear a horrible hissing from behind. Turning you see a giant spider
approaching.

;Player hit points = 11

Taking advantage of its bad luck, you use your massive attack talent and strike
down with your axe cracking its carapace open in a long oozing crack for 16
points of damage. You quickly hack and hack and hack the stunned creature for 3
points, another 3 points, and then finally 2 points of damage, killing it.

!room.notes="dead spider. long crack on carapace."

Search about you find nothing of interest.

You continue following the passage and come to an opening leading outside. You
have discovered another way into and out of the complex.

You have more loot to collect and head back down the tunnel back to the cave.

Examining the empty alcove you see it is actually a cleverly disguised door
leading to another area!

Opening the door you step inside to a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are
covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far wall you see
a mummmified corpose that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X.

There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to your left.

The two spiders close in and latch onto you with their forelegs. Each sinks its

You step into the pond and grope around feeling along its rough bottom. When
you reach the center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can pull up on. You pull up on
the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. You toss
the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow depression with a

Suddenly you hear two thuds, one from your left, the other from your right.
Glancing about you see two giant spiders advancing.

You see a nicely made pair of black felt boots with a soft sole that looks like
it was made for being quiet. You also see two sets of gauntlets, the first set
has a picture of a man's bicep with lightning bolts around. The second set has
the picture of a large upraised fist. The goggles reveal themselves to provide
vision in the dark when you look through the lenses.

Swinging the monstrous axe, you strike each skeleton in turn, shattering them
one by one. With two whacks, you gut the zombie and it falls.

As you look about after the battle, you realize you can see in the shadows as
clearly as in the torchlight. The axe grants darkvision! Wow! This weapon is
amazing! As you retrieve your one handed axe to put it into your backpack, you
find a headband on the plinth as well. It is made of soft black felt with red
trim.

The zombie starts trying to claw its way out of the pile of rubble, but you put
and end to that quickly enough with a single stroke of the axe. All the undead
are squashed.

Walking over you set the torch down on the plinth and pick up the two-handed
weapon.

Amazingly your vision sharpens and you can see further than the torch light
casts. The thing grants darkvision!

You immediately put your axe away in your backpack and hefting the two handed
weapon decide what to do next.

You enter a 90ft x 40ft room full of wine and ale casks. Many of the casks are
busted open. You don't see any doors or passages in the room.

You start searching for loot through the debris when four giant rats leap out
to attack you!

The third and fourth rats attack the second rat from two different sides at
once. It doesn't last long under the onslaught. They turn to look at you with
blood dripping from their maws. These are some mean looking rats!

The rats engage. Using your massive attack talent you deal the fourth rat 10
points of damage. It retaliates with a bite taking 2 points of your health. You
hack at it again and it drops to the floor twitching. The third rat takes
advantage of your distraction with the fourth rat and neatly severes you head
from you body in a single bite.

You have perished.

You return to the room of corpse filled alcoves. In the room on the floor is a
skeleton and two corpses.

A glint of something catches your eye on one of the corpses. Walking over, you
discover a tin of ointment in a pocket of the shredded remains of pants on the
corpse.

It looks like it could be a healing ointment.

You stash it in your front right pocket.

You put the goggles on and realize you can see into every shadow in the room
cast by the torch light. Great! This grants darkvision! You extinguish your
torch, freeing up a hand.

Searching about the room, you find nothing else of interest.

You are at the entrance to a 40ft by 30ft room. All the walls are covered with

corpse that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X. There is a small open chest
in the far corner of the room to the left.

You enter the room and immediately notice that except for the cross with the
mummified corpse that the only other item of interest is the open chest. Walking
over to it you see three items inside.

* A pair boots
* A pair of gloves

Feeling weak, you realize your health is low and cast healing hand exhausting
your mana.

You hear moaning coming from the entrance. Looking up from where you were
preparing to go through the gear, you see two zombies approaching.

The zombies attack with surprising ferocity. You dodge their initial strikes,
and you manage to hack the first zombie's head mostly off in a single swing, but
it keeps attacking. It manages to scratch you for 1 point of damage. In
retaliation you hack at the zombies repeatably until they both drop. It takes
four hits to take out the second zombie. But only two for the first.

You start examining the gear, picking each item up each in turn carefully and
considering it.

!list_items(locals()) # 
;##  boots: Boots of Striding and Springing, +2 (#1)
;##  gloves: Gloves of Swimming and Climbing (#1)
;##  ring: Ring of Slowness, Rogue -1 (#1)

You pick up the boots. Covered in a black soft felt material they seem superbly
made and expensive.

Turning the gloves over in your hand, you notice they are webbed between the
fingures and have tiny bowl like indentations on the fingure tips.

The ring is flat black color, making it look ideal for something for sneaking
around if it has magic. Looking inside the inner band on the ring, you see a
pair of shoes with wings on them.

Taking the initative and striking while the zombie tries to unimpale itself
from the skeletons sword, you strike the skeleton, crushing its chest, then
decapitate the zombie. With a final swish of your axe you also decapitate the
skeleton warrior.

Quickly searching through the alcoves you find nothing of value.

You continue down the passageway heading back to the 4-way intersection.

You pick the amulet up and examine it closely. It is bronze in color, feels
warm to the touch, and has engravings of individual fists on both sides. It
feels like you should put it on.

You pick up the armor and examine it closely. It appears to be expertly crafted
scale mail. Definitely looks better than one you normally find available for
sale with merchents.

The bag is made of a expensive fine black velvet with a black leather
drawstring. You hear clinking when you pick it up.

You pick up the gauntlets and look over them carefully. They are bronze in
color with decorative swirls surrounding various engravings of fists and large
firm biceps. It feels like you should equip this gear.

You pick up the ring. It is a simple band with a tourmaline set into it. You
notice faint engravings of snowflakes on the inner band.

You pick up the wand and examine it closely. It looks to be made of willow
tree. Near its base you see 4 tiny blue gem stone slivers. One of them appears
dark. The other three glow with a faint inner light.

You pick up the mace and examine it. About 2ft long, it is made of steel and
ends in a spiked head. It is plain looking not having any decorations.

You start searching the alcoves for loot when you hear a moan and clanking
noises from the entrance.

Turning you see a skeleton warrior and three zombies rushing towards you.

As they rush you a zombie gets in the way of a sword thrust from the zombie and
takes a strike in the back.

As the skeleton is pulling its sword out of the first zombie, the remaining
zombies attack from all sides. You are not able to defense yourself against the
onslaught.

You are a zombie.

NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

You wake up on the top of a barren hill. You see a two-handed black axe, a set
of black chain mail armor, and a flight of stairs heading down into the ground.

Looking about you see a purple sky filled with green stars. There are
occasional forks of lightning off in the distance and orange flashes on the
horizon in all directions. Looking down from the barren hilltop you see that
everything past the base of the hill is shrouded is a deep gloom with some sort
of sea composed of roiling black fog all around. You get the feeling if you walk
down into the black fog, you would not come back out.

You realize that all of your stuff is gone. You only have what clothes you are
wearing!

You hear squeaking noises coming from the stairwell.
