Atop of the hill stand the ruins of what was once an abbey.
Legend has it that long ago the studious monks became corrupted by some evil
and were destroyed by a band of wizards.

As a new adventurer you have come seeking loot. Hopefully stuff that will
help with future adventures, or at least enough money to get a meal and
room at a decent inn.

You walk up the hill to the ruins.

Digging through the rumble you happen upon a flight of stairs leading down underground.

:Go down the stairs|d70ae699

[Go down the stairs|d70ae699] (d91ac75b)
; Start the Game|906d2fff

You walk down one flight of stairs, then another and come to a bend in passageway.

You see another flight of stairs disappearing into darkness.

:Continue Downwards|85aacc47

[Light a torch|2e3f2197] (d70ae699)
!torches= 2 # @torches: torches - 1
TORCHES REMAINING: 2

You light a torch and peer deeper into the stairwell. The floor
at the bend looks odd. Examining it closer you determine that it is
probably trapped and proceed to disarm it.

; "FAIL 3 < 9" # @dl_check("Challenging", player.rogue) # disarm
; False # @roll("1d6")==1 # trigger

You proceed to head downwards when suddenly you feel the floor
shift downwards beneath you. You hurry across the remaining distance
to the next flight of stairs heading down. The floor does not shift anymore.

; (False, '') # @random_encounter_check()

You go down the stairs and follow a passage 3 meters before it comes to
a bend turning to your right.

; (True, '1 giant beetle') # @random_encounter_check()
!beetle= unpickle("{\"py/object\": \"character_sheet.CharacterSheet\", \"name\": \"Giant Beetle\", \"description\": \"\", \"weapons\": [{\"py/object\": \"equipment.Weapon\", \"name\": \"Bite\", \"skill\": {\"py/object\": \"skills.CharacterSkill\", \"skill_name\": \"Unarmed\", \"skill_attribute\": {\"py/reduce\": [{\"py/type\": \"skills.SkillAttribute\"}, {\"py/tuple\": [3]}]}}, \"_damage\": \"1d6\", \"cost_sp\": 0, \"_two_handed\": false}], \"armor_worn\": [], \"skills\": [], \"talents\": [], \"spells\": [], \"equipment\": [], \"warrior\": 4, \"rogue\": 4, \"mage\": 0, \"adv_taken\": 0, \"fate\": 4, \"fate_starting\": 4, \"armor_penalty\": 0, \"hit_points_max\": 14, \"mana_max\": 0, \"defense\": 8, \"_hit_points\": 14, \"mana\": 0, \"base_defense\": 8, \"armor\": 0, \"hit_points_armor\": 15}") # @beetle: NPC.giant_beetle()

Suddenly you hear scurrying up ahead just as a giant beetle comes into view!

[Run Past|04d830bb] (2e3f2197)
!run_past= "FAIL 5 < 9" # @run_past: dl_check("Challenging", player.rogue)

As you try to quickly skirt around the terrifying insect, it blocks your path so you can't pass by.

!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [14, 14]}") # @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg)

Faster than you can react the beetle is upon you. Avoiding the gnashing mandibles
you swing your axe at the beetle. It leaves a slight gouge.

; "Success" # @attack(beetle.warrior, player.defense)
!dmg= "1d6" # @dmg: beetle.weapon.damage

!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [14, 12]}") # @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg)

Again the beetle lunges at you and manages to bite into your armor and lunges
backward leaving a long ragged tear. Again your axe swipe leaves a slight gouge.

; "Fail" # @attack(beetle.warrior, player.defense)

!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [14, 1]}") # @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg)

The beetle scurries towards you and you step aside while launching a massive axe
swing into its side. With a crunching sound you see a long crack form in the
carapace. But that doesn't seem to slow it down any.

; "Fail" # @attack(beetle.warrior, player.defense)
; "Success" # @attack(player.warrior, beetle.defense)

!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [14, 0]}") # @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg)

Again you avoid its mandibles and swing and cause another crack to form.

!dmg= "1d6 + 2"  #- @dmg: beetle.weapons[0].damage -#
!player.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [3, 0]}") # @player.hps: damage_against(player, dmg)

!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [10, 0]}") # @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg)

The beetle lunges at you and again tears into your armor leaving it nothing but
shreds of leather! You jump over slashing downward with your axe and strike into
the soft tissue in one of the cracks.

; "Mana: 6/6" # @player.reset_armor_penalty()
!player.mana= 6 # @player.mana: player.mana

!dmg= "1d6"
!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [7, 0]}")  #- @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg) -#

You feel the sting as mandibles tear at the flesh of your left calf. You swing wildly back
and succeed into digging into more soft flesh. The beetle seems to have slowed somewhat.

; "Fail" # @attack(beetle.warrior, player.defense)
; "Success" # @attack(player.warrior, beetle.defense)
!dmg= "1d6"  #- @dmg: player.weapons[0].damage -#
!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [5, 0]}")  #- @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg) -#

The beetle scurries towards you. Blocking its approach with an axe swing, you add another
crack into its carapace.

; "Success" # @attack(beetle.warrior, player.defense)
!dmg= "1d6"  #- @dmg: beetle.weapons[0].damage -#
!player.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [1, 0]}")  #- @player.hps: damage_against(player, dmg) -#

!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [4, 0]}")  #- @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg) -#

The beetle now bites into your right calf. You chip off another piece of carapace with your axe.

; "Fail" # @attack(beetle.warrior, player.defense)
; "Fail" # @attack(player.warrior, beetle.defense)

The beetle slowly circles looking for an opening as you do the same.

; "Fail" # @attack(beetle.warrior, player.defense)
; "Success" # @attack(player.warrior, beetle.defense)
!dmg= "1d6"  #- @dmg: player.weapons[0].damage -#
!beetle.hps= unpickle("{\"py/tuple\": [0, 0]}")  #- @beetle.hps: damage_against(beetle, dmg) -#

With a final swing you plunge your axe deep enough into its soft tissues
to end its life.

You are nearly dead.

covering every wall. In the alcoves rest the bones of long dead monks.

Putting your weight behind it, you manage to open the porticullus
with the screeching sound of long rusted metal. As the gate opens
you see a dead body in a corner of the room to the right of the entrance.

You go down 150 meters and come to a tiled cave. This roughly domed room has been carved in the rock and its floor
is covered with square black marble tiles. You notice that the air feels much cooler here. The room is bare except for
a large two-handed axe on a display stand in the middle of the room. You notice that it appears beautifully mastered.

As you continue examining the walls suddenly a spectral hand pops out of the wall near one of your hands grasping about
like it is trying to grab you. As you jerk back away from the spectral hand, whatever it is attached to suddenly surges
out of the wall up to its elbow, grabs you, and pulls you into utter blackness. You feel your life essence fade as
everything fades away.

the blade. Soon it becomes bright as a torch and stops getting brighter. As you stand there staring at the axe in awe,
you realize that you know longer need to carry a torch to be able to see. You place your one handed axe into your
backpack and equip the two-handed one.
