Atop of the hill stand the ruins of what was once an abbey.
Legend has it that long ago the studious monks became corrupted by some evil
and were destroyed by a band of wizards.

As a new adventurer you have come seeking loot. Hopefully stuff that will
help with future adventures, or at least enough money to get a meal and
room at a decent inn.

You walk up the hill to the ruins.

Digging through the rumble you happen upon a flight of stairs leading down underground.
