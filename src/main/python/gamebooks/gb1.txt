Atop of the hill stand the ruins of what was once an abbey.
Legend has it that long ago the studious monks became corrupted by some evil
and were destroyed by a band of wizards.

As a new adventurer you have come seeking loot. Hopefully stuff that will
help with future adventures, or at least enough money to get a meal and
room at a decent inn.

You walk up the hill to the ruins.

Digging through the rumble you happen upon a flight of stairs leading down underground.

!location= "1" # @location: "stairs down 1"
!room=rooms(location)
!room # ROOM: 1 (1)
;##  a flight of stairs and come to a short 10ft passageway which ends at a
;##  wall with an opening to another flight of stairs heading down into
;##  darkness.

You walk down a flight of stairs and come to a short 10ft passageway which ends at a wall with an opening
to another flight of stairs heading down into darkness.

!torches= 2 # @torches: torches - 1

You light a torch and enter the passageway turning to the right and follow the stairs down a landing which leads
straight ahead to another set of stairs going down. You follow those stairs down and walk through a short passageway
that makes a right turn into a much longer passageway disappearing into darkness.

;##  A four way intersection. E is where you came in. N, S, W disappear
;##  into darkness.

You stop and listening carefully before proceeding. You only hear your own breathing. Deciding there is nothing
waiting to attack you in the darkess beyond the reach of the torch light you continue on.

You follow the passage for 60ft and come to a four way intersection. The passages left, straight ahead, and right
disappear into darkness.

You follow the passage and come to a closed portcullis. Looking through the bars you see a 90ft x 40ft room with
alcoves in all the walls. From here you cannot see into the alcoves as their contents are shrouded in darkness.

You cross the intersection and enter the passageway in front of you.
You walk for 60ft and come to an opening into a large cave.

Water oozes down the walls of this natural cave and forms a 30ft
diameter pond in the middle of it. You notice water dripping from the

You start going from alcove to alcove check the skeletons and corpses for any possible loot when you hear a clink

Rushing forward you use your massive attack talent and destroy the skeleton in one blow. You follow that up with
two quick strikes on the first zombie, severing its head and killing it.
Swinging back around you slice a long gash across the second zombie's chest dealing 4 points of damage.

You finish looting the alcoves and find a potion and two rings.

Examining the potion you see it has the picture of wings on it.

The first ring has depictions of snowflakes artfully engraved over its entire circumfrence.

The second ring has a picture of a shield engraved on its inside but is otherwise plain.

Pulling up on the edge of what you can now tell is some sort of metal plate you grope around under it and find a medium
sack.

Emptying the sack out you find a ring and a set of gauntlets. The ring has a picture of a shield engraved on its inner
ring. The guantlets are nicely decorated and each one has an engraving of a fist.

You suddenly hear hissing coming from the doorway out of the cave. Looking over quickly you see a giant spider

The second skeleton strikes back and hits you for 1 point of damage.

The second skeleton makes another successful strike and hits you for 1 point of damage.
Swinging your axe back around in a wide arc you shatter the skulls of the two remaining skeletons.

HIT POINTS REMAINING: 9

You walk over, pickup, and examine the axe.

The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting edges.
The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark blood red arcane symbols.
The top of the handgrap has a circle of dark blood red leather as does the bottom of the handgrip.
From the edge of the hasp dangles a dark blood red leather strip loop.

You feel a sense of malice eminating off of the axe, though it doesn't seem directed at you.

Carefully setting your torch down on the plynth so not as to let it go out, you heft the two-handed battle axe
and test its weight and balance.

You suddenly notice something odd. All the shadows in the room seem to have receded away from you. As you look about
you see that the torch is still casting shadows, but you can now see into them.

As a test you extinguish the torch and realize you can still see perfectly fine! Setting the axe down on the plynth,
you wait to see how long the effect lasts. While there is a noticible immediate darkening of the room, the ability
seems to last quite a while. This seems handy, no torch required! You decide to pick the axe back up and use it.

Examining the empty alcove you see it is actually a cleverly disguised door leading to another area!

Opening the door you step inside to a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are covered with depictions of evil
and bloody looking acts. On the far wall you see a mummmified corpose that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X.

There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to your left.

* A black cloth bag.
* A set of guantlets.
* A ring with a tourmaline set in it.
* A wand.

You head down the long passage heading toward the stairs which go back up to the surface. You stop and listen carefully.
You don't hear any sign of pursuit.

You decide to wait a few more minutes before carefully heading back to the four way. Taking stock of your health, you
decide healing is in order.

Casting Healing Hand twice you regain full health.

You decide this really sucks! All this running around and no loot yet! You decide to try harder to get something!

You head back to the four way intersection.

Taking advantage of the rats feasting on the zombies you wade in hacking and slashing with your axe. It turns into
a slug fest as you hack and hack and hack. Finally, the last rodent lies twitching on the floor. And not a scratch!

another cask shifts, and you see the glowing red eyes of a giant rat staring out at you.

before it manages to leave a scratch down one of your arms. With a final chop, you end its life.

You grope around in the pond feeling along its rough bottom. When you reach the center you notice
the texture suddenly becomes very smooth. Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can probably pull up on.

You pull up on the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. Feeling down where it was you find
a shallow depression with a sack in it.

You enter a very large crack in the cave wall and go about 30 ft and
notice the ground starting to slope upwards. Out of the darkness in front of you
leaps a giant spider.

As it leaps forward to sink its fangs into your tastyness you hear a loud crack from above and see a stalactite

Your hope that the stalactite had done enough damage to make the spider be easy pickings comes to naught. With two
quick jabs of its fangs, it injects enough venom in for you to instantly black out.

You are spider fodder.

yourself jumped by two giant rats. Taking the initiative you swing the axe to great effect. You strike the first rat

comes back for more, then finally break the back of the surviving rat.

You pick the amulet up and examine it closely. It is bronze in color, feels warm to the touch, and has engravings of
individual fists on both sides. It feels like you should put it on.

You pick up the armor and examine it closely. It appears to be expertly crafted scale mail.
Definitely looks better than one you normally find available for sale with merchents.

The bag is made of a expensive fine black velvet with a black leather drawstring. You hear clinking when you pick it up.

You pick up the gauntlets and look over them carefully. They are bronze in color with decorative swirls surrounding
various engravings of fists and large firm biceps. It feels like you should equip this gear.

You pick up the ring. It is a simple band with a tourmaline set into it. You notice faint engravings of snowflakes
on the inner band.

You pick up the wand and examine it closely. It looks to be made of willow tree. Near its base you see 4 tiny blue
gem stone slivers. One of them appears dark. The other three glow with a faint inner light.

You pick up the mace and examine it. About 2ft long, it is made of steel and ends in a spiked head. It is plain looking
not having any decorations.

They keep getting in the way of each other as they advance. They must really be hungry.

with blood and a voice booms out: "Do a task for me and live. Refuse and die."

You are in the cave with pond in the middle.
There is a large crack in wall to your left.

; (False, '') # @wander()

Peering inside the cave you see nothing moving, so you proceed to search the pond.

Feeling around in the pond you come to a smooth spot with an edge, like a board. You pull up on the edge
and fish out a metal plate. Feeling around where the plate was you find a depression with a sack.

You pull the sack free, step out of the pond, and dump its contents onto the floor for perusal.

The only thing that falls out besides a little mud is a potion vial. Examining it you see that there is a picture
of a closed on on the vial. You stash it in your backpack.

Further searching reveals nothing of interest so you return to the 4-way intersection.

The zombies attack with surprising ferocity.

It manages to scratch you for 1 point of damage.
In retaliation you hack at the zombies repeatably until they both drop.
It takes four hits to take out the second zombie. But only two for the first.

You start examining the gear, picking each item up each in turn carefully and considering it.

You pick up the boots. Covered in a black soft felt material they seem superbly made and expensive.

Turning the gloves over in your hand, you notice they are webbed between the fingures
and have tiny bowl like indentations on the fingure tips.

The ring is flat black color, making it look ideal for something for sneaking around if it has magic.
Looking inside the inner band on the ring, you see a pair of shoes with wings on them.

The first item you pick up is the amulet. Gold in color, it has a small picture of a human heart on it.

Secondly you look at the boots. They are finely made and covered with a soft black felt. The soles seem like they
would make walking and running quieter.

The gauntlets are a bronze with pictures of a person's bicep with lightning bolts leaping out. They have an
extra special thrum about them.

The two potion vials each have a different mark in their surface. One is pictures of wings, the second picture
being of a human heart. You stow them into a pocket for easy access.

Starting on the right you grope around in the pond feeling along its rough bottom.
Not far far in and the the texture suddenly becomes very smooth in a small square patch.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can probably pull up on.

You pull up on the edge and a small metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. Feeling down where it was you find
a shallow depression with a sack in it. You snatch the sack up out of the water.

Suddenly you hear two heavy thuds behind you. Looking you see two giant
spiders between you and the exit. As you turn to face them you hear gurgling noises coming from the other side of
the pond. Taking a quick glance, you see a skeleton warrior climbing up from where it had been laying
just under the surface of the water.

A mighty struggle ensues between you and hungry monster. The spider leaps at you and you dodge. You quickly
hammer in two axe chops for 11 points and 4 points of damage. The spider retaliates striking you with one
of its legs for 2 points of damage. Again you strike two times for a total of 8 points of damage. The spider
looks weakened, but it still has fight as it slashes at you again with a leg and causes another 2 points of
damage. With a final swing of the axe, you terminate the beast.

You continue following the passage and come to an opening to the outside. You have found another way
in and out of the complex.

You still have loot to seek.

The rats engage. Using your massive attack talent you deal the fourth rat 10 points of damage. It retaliates
with a bite taking 2 points of your health. You hack at it again and it drops to the floor twitching. The third
rat takes advantage of your distraction with the fourth rat and neatly severes you head from you body in a single bite.

You have perished.
