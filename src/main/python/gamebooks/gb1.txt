Atop of the hill stand the ruins of what was once an abbey. Legend has it that
long ago the studious monks became corrupted by some evil and were destroyed by
a band of wizards.

As a new adventurer you have come seeking loot. Hopefully stuff that will help
with future adventures, or at least enough money to get a meal and room at a
decent inn.

You walk up the hill to the ruins.

Digging through the rumble you happen upon a flight of stairs leading down
underground.

You walk down a flight of stairs and come to a short 10ft passageway which ends
at a wall with an opening to another flight of stairs heading down into
darkness.

You light a torch and enter the passageway turning to the right and follow the
stairs down a landing which leads straight ahead to another set of stairs going
down. You follow those stairs down and walk through a short passageway that
makes a right turn into a much longer passageway disappearing into darkness.

You stop and listening carefully before proceeding. You only hear your own
breathing. Deciding there is nothing waiting to attack you in the darkess beyond
the reach of the torch light you continue on.

You follow the passage for 60ft and come to a four way intersection. The
passages left, straight ahead, and right disappear into darkness.

You cross the intersection and enter the passageway in front of you. You walk
for 60ft and come to an opening into a large cave.

Water oozes down the walls of this natural cave and forms a 30ft diameter pond
in the middle of it. You notice water dripping from the cave roof about 30ft
above. From the pond a rivulet of water heads into the crack which appears large

You search about the room peering into the corners and at the casks. Suddenly
one of the casks on your left shifts and you hear a moaning sound. You see a
zombie stumble into the torch light. As you prepare to fight the zombie another
cask shifts, and you see the glowing red eyes of a giant rat staring out at you.

See the two opponents, you decide to take care of the zombie first. With three
quick strikes, down, up, down it is done for and falls to the ground inert. You
lean sideways as the rat leaps toward you and put a few quick hacks into it
before it manages to leave a scratch down one of your arms. With a final chop,
you end its life.

You continue searching the room and find a very nice longbow tucked up
underneath some casks. While not directly useful, it may fetch some decent
silver at the weaponsmith's.

You find nothing else of interest.

Using your massive attack talent you strike the first one knocking it into a

You put the boots on. They fit perfectly! Walking around a little you notice
they seem to give you an extra spring in the step.

Finished in this room, you head upstairs back to the 3-way intersection.

The skeletons take aim and loose two bolts. One bounces off harmlessly but the
second is a lucky strike and pierces your left shoulder at your armor's seem. It
doesn't go deep though and falls away leaving a shallow gash.

Swinging back with and using your massive attack talent you decapitate one of
the zombies.

hole in its chest.

FATE - 1. FATE POINTS REMAINING: 1

An arrow shot from a skeleton looks perfectly aimed to strike you in the face
when a zombie shifts in front of the bolt and blocks it from hitting you. The
zombie collapses to the floor. You rush the skeletons one by one to kill them
before they kill you.

!zomb2.hp= 0 # @zomb2.hp: skel1.damage_opponent(zomb2)

The skeleton archers appear to be out of arrows as the second one rushes you
swinging its bow like a club.

You quickly end the two skeletal threats with one fatal strike each.

Setting the torch aside on the plynth, you pick up the two handed war axe.
Suddenly everything in the room seems brighter than before. Looking about you
notice that you can see into places where the torch light does not reach. Yes!
It's an enchanted weapon which grants dark sight!

you.

Setting the torch and your weapon down on the plynth, you heft the fancy two-

You come to a portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves in the
walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here. You push the portcullis open
with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step into the room. You can now
see into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and corpses
of monks, except one. Which is in the right wall in the near corner.

You discover a cleverly disguised door. Opening it up you step into a 40ft x
30ft room. All the walls are covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking
acts. On the far E wall you see a mummified corpse that is tied with barbed wire

Stepping over to the chest and peering in you see the chest is empty except for
a lone ring in one of the corners. Probably missed by whoever looted the chest
previously. Picking the ring up and examining it you see it is plainly crafted,
though of obvious high quality. You discover the etching of a shield on the
inner side of the ring.

"Ah! Entertainment! Agree to do a task for me and have a chance to live. Refuse

You refuse to accept such a likely dark bargain. Death would preferable.

The undead horde tears you to shreds.

You have perished.

As you stow the ring in your backpack, movement from the entrance catches your
eye.

You see multiple giant beetles swarming into the room.

Rushing forwards you wade into the creatures and start laying waste with your
two-handed axe. Ichor flies everywhere coating everything around you as you chop
open one beetle after another. During the melee two of the beasts get past your
guard and bite for a total of three points of damage.

Looking at the mess, you count carcasses. You killed eight giant beetles.

Casting about the room you find nothing else of interest.

The floating axe sweeps out in wide arcs, neatly severing all of the undead
into various sized chunks.

Everything goes dark.

You rush down the stairs back into the room of busted casks. There are two
corpses here. One of a zombie. The other of a giant rat.

You lay into the skeletons with all your might.

Using your massive attack talent you strike the closes skeleton for 9 points
and it drops unmoving to the floor. Using fancy footwork you dance about the
remaining two skeletons and deliver multiple strikes. A second skeleton drops.
You strike the last skeleton and you fail to dodge its return strike. It stabs
you for 7 points of damage. You feel the fight leave you as the axe clatters to

As you continue walking up the slope you come upon the aftermatch of a

bodies of six giant rats.

They seem intent on eating the spiders, at least for the moment. A short and
very one sided battle ensues. The spiders quickly stab out with their forelegs,
each one quickly dragging a weasel within biting range, where they immediately
shove their fangs in a inject venom.

In short order the weasels are motionless. The spiders begin adding them to
their larder.

You return to the cave with pond in the middle. The entrance to the cave is to
your right.You see a lot of giant beetle carcasses.

It occurs to you that the number of wandering monsters has been steadily
increasing. It might be time to get out of the complex before something bad

You step into the pond and grope around feeling along its rough bottom. When
you reach the center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can pull up on. You pull up on
the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. You toss
the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow depression with a
heavy sack in it. You drag the sack out to lie next to the pond. As you prepare
to open the sack, you notice kobolds pouring into the cave from the entrance.

You run up the stairs and rush the rats with your axe upraised.

You hit first giant rat for 6 points of damage, dodge the rat's return attack,
then hit the third rat for 10 points of damage.

The first rat gets past your defenses and hits you for 2 points of damage.

You strike the first rat again for another point of damage.

The second and fourth rats get past your defenses and hit you for a total of 4
points of damage.

You strike out and hit the first rat for 1 point of damage with a follow up
strike against the fourth rat for two points of damage. The fourth rat drops,
twitching, to the floor.

You manage to hit the third rat for one point of damage before the second rat
gets past your defenses and hits. Your health is gone. You drop as the rats
swarm over you.

You have perished.

damage, killing it instantly. You expertly dodge their return strikes between
each of your strikes. You strike the second goblin for 4 points, again for 2
points, and finally for another 2 points killing it. You continue expertly
dodging return strikes. You strike the third goblin for 2 points, again for 3
points, and finally for another 3 points killing it.

You go down a 60 ft passage and come to a natural cave. Water oozes down the
walls and forms a 30ft diameter pond in the middle of it. You notice water
dripping from the cave roof about 30ft above. From the pond a rivulet of water
heads into a large crack in the middle of the left wall which appears large
enough to walk into. The pond is covered in what appears to be a dark green

Four goblin warriors approach you with weapons at the ready. The seem to gaze
upon like you would yourself upon seeing a fantastic meal. You prepare to fight.

You strike quick and hard dealing damage two of the goblins while dodging blows
and kill a third. One goblin, hanging back, strikes between its companions
hitting you for 4 points of damage. Ouch. You finish off another goblin just
before the one hanging back manages to hit you with a death blow.

You have perished.

As you walk over to the nearest alcove to check for anything of value, the
skeleton in it suddenly rises up, its heads swivel to look in your direction,
then it starts walking towards you with a short sword clutched in its bony
fingures. From adjacent alcoves three zombies step out.

Brandeshing your axe with expert care, you step forward and strike down the
skeleton with a single stroke and on the follow through manage to hit a zombie
for 2 points of damage. It returns the favor and hits you for 3 points of
damage. Taking relish in the vanguishing you repeatably strike at the zombies
until they all collapse to the floor unmoving.

Searching the alcoves you find a finely crafted headband.

You stow the headband in your backpack before walking over to the one empty
alcove.

!player.equipment.append(room.pop_item("headband"))

When you examine the empty alcove, you find it is actually a cleverly hidden
door.

Opening it up you step inside.

You step into  a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are covered with depictions of
evil and bloody looking acts. On the far E wall you see a mummified corpse that
is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X. There is a small open chest in the far

Walking over to the chest and looking inside you see a sword. Picking it up and
hefting it reveals it to be an excellent weapon. As your specialty is axes you
stow it across your back to sell later.

Searching through the rest of the room reveals nothing of interest.

You wait as they rush forwards, then lay waste to the kobolds as they enter the
shallow pond. They strike out with ineffective blows against you, as you wield
your two-handed axe like a scithe mowing down wheat. Every strike made is a
kobold dead.

Well, that didn't take long.

This place does seem to be getting busier and busier with monsters.

You dump the sack out and find a set of finely crafted chain mail. You detect
no signs of rust even though it has been submerged for an unknown period of
time.

You rush down the passageway and come to a portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x
40ft room with alcoves in the walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here.
You push the portcullis open with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step
into the room. That's not good, it may attract the weasel horde! You can now see
into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and corpses of
monks, except one in the right wall in the near corner.

The goblins come in swinging. Ducking, dodging, and weaving about, you strike
out four times with your axe dealing damage to four goblins doling out 7 points,
6 points, 4 points, and 5 points of damage. One of the goblins then manages to
get past your defense and hits you for 3 points of damage. Striking out twice
more in quick succession you kill two of the goblins.

Just as another goblin comes in with what looks like a killing blow, one of
their group stumbles and knocks the strike off target. It missings you entirely.

There are five goblins arrayed against you. Two goblins lie dead on the floor.

You strike the spider using your massive attack talent for 17 points of damage.
It manages to get two blows in from its forelegs for 3 ponts and 1 point of
damage each. You strike it between the eyes, cracking open its head for a final
7 points of damage, killing it.

You are gravely wounded and take the time to heal yourself.

You come to a portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves in the
walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here. You push the portcullis open
with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step into the room. You can now
see into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and corpses
of monks, except one in the right wall in the near corner.

You follow the passage for 50ft and come to a cave with a tiled floor. You see
a stone plynth on the far side holding a two handed war axe. Even from this
distance you can tell that it is a finely crafted weapon. Next to the plynth on
the floor you see the remains of a monk with several arrows in its back. It
looks like the monk was trying to reach the axe before being struck down. As you
look beyond the dead monk you see figures moving into the torchlight.

It is a large horde of the undead! A multitude of skeleton warriors and zombies
approach. Looks like there are close to twenty!

force ebbs away. You get three more hits in: -1, -1, then -2, before one of the
weasels gets past your defenses hitting you for 3 points, sapping the last of
your health. You collapse and the weasels take to feasting.

You have perished.

Rushing down the passage way you find yourself barrelling through a large group
of skeleton warriors! Luckily, you make it past them before they fully react.

Heading up the various flights of stairs, you make it to the surface.
Immediately, you head back to town.

!player.hp = player.hit_points_max

After resting and healing overnight, you make your way to the market to visit
the various vendors and to discover what all you claimed as loot.

It turns into a slug fest of epic proportions. Ducking, dodging, and weaving

skeletons and six zombies before being reduced to 1 point of health.

You rush by the weasels in such a hurry that you leave them looking stunned in
your wake.

You come to an open portcullis leading into a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves in
the walls. You notice the alcoves are filled with the skeletons and corpses of
monks. Though the biggest attention getter is the pack of worgs munching bones
in the alcoves. As a group, they turn to face you. In there eyes you can see
them thinking, "Fresh Meat!"

You are seriously injured and have no mana.

about your throat and begins chowing down. The other worgs follow suit.

You are worg food.

As you rush through the intersection going as fast as you can, you here a storm
of squeaks coming from the passage to your right. Glancing that way as you pass,
you see a wall of red glittering eyes heading your way.

Rushing down 100ft of tunnel you come to the stairwell leading to the surface.
Taking the steps two and three at a time you make it back to the surface and
hurry back to town.

You have successfully made it out alive to tell the tale.

After reaching town, you rest and heal overnight.

The next day you go visit the merchents to see what loot you have gained.

points of damage. You get two strikes in hitting the second rat for 2 points of
damage and killing the first rat. The third rat sneaks in and claws you for 2
points of damage. You strike back at the two remaining rodents, but only manage
two weak attacks of 1 point each agains the critters. The third rat manages to
trip you up causing you to fall. The rats tear into you, ending your life.

You have perished.

Seeing the need for escape,you rush down 100ft of passage and reach the
stairwell leading out of the complex.

Heading up, you return to the ruins of the abbey.

You return to town and spend some time healing and resting.

The next day you go visiting various shops to see what you have collected.

You come to a portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves in the
walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here. You push the portcullis open
with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step into the room. You can now
see into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and corpses
of monks, except one in the right wall in the near corner. You hear growling and
snuffling noises coming from the entrance. Turning to look you see the room is
starting to fill up with giant weasels!

remaing weasels gets past your defense and bites your throat out.

You come to a portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves in the
walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here. You push the portcullis open
with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step into the room. You can now
see into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and corpses
of monks, except one in the right wall in the near corner.

short sword intending to kill you! Jumping back, you see several other occupants

You hit the first skeleton for 7 points of damage. Avoiding return strikes you
hit a zombie for 11 points of damage. Dodging another set of strikes, you hit
the first skeleton a second time for 2 points of damage and it drops. As the
skeleton falls, a zombie gets past your defenses and hits you for 3 points of
damage, leaving you only 3 health left. Swinging you axe back around you hit the
second skeleton for a measly 1 point of damage when the zombie reaches in and
bites into your throat. Everything goes dark.

You are now a zombie.

You wade in with your axe and the battle ensues. It turns into a slog fest. You
strike out again and again, chipping carapaces and cracking shells letting ichor
to ooze out. It takes seventeen blows but you slaughter them all. You only get
bit twice, for a total of 6 points of damage.

mana.

You strike the first zombie with your axe for 5 points of damage. The second
zombie tears into you clased hands and takes 5 points of health from you. You
strike out again and hit the third zombie for two quick strikes in success but
only manage to deal 3 points of damage. The first zombie reaches out and pulls
you in for a massive neck bite. You blood sprayes everywhere.

You have perished.

walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here. You push the portcullis open
with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step into the room. You can now
see into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and corpses
of monks, except one in the right wall in the near corner.

You rush in swinging with what feels like extra strength! You strike the first
spider for 10 points of damage with a followup in the second spider for 2 pionts
of damage. Expertly dodging their forelimb strikes and fangs, you strike the
first spider twice for 5 points of damage, killing it. With a flourish you smash
the blade of your axe into the remaining spider for 7 points of damage, cracking
it open. It dies.

Using your massive attack talent, you hit the first spider for 14 points of
damage, but it keeps on fighting. Dodging blows, you hit two of the spiders for
a total of 5 points. One of the spiders gets past your defense and stabs you
with a forelimb for 6 points of damage. You return with a weak strike only
dealing 1 point of damage. A spider which had been hanging back, leaps forward,
with the intent of finishing you.

You flee into the crack. Heading upslope you come across seven dead weasels in
various states of being coccooned up.

Taking advantage of not being attacked, you cast Healing Hand on yourself.

;;; !Macro.heal()

!player.mana= 0 # @player.mana: player.mana
!hp= 5 # @hp: roll('1d6') if cast else 0
!player.hp= 11 # @player.hp: player.hp + hp

You regain full health, but are now out of mana.

As you continue upslope you, three giant rats come into view.

You make short work of the rats, hacking and slashing them all with brutal
efficiency. One of the buggers got you for four points of damage though.

You continue upslope and come to an opening. Peering out, you see the hillside
with the ruins of the abbey just above you.

Stowing the belt away quietly in your backpack, you sneak back into the crack
and follow it upslope till you exit the complex.

You spend a well deserved night resting and healing.

The next day you go and visit the local merchants to see what things of value
you may have acquired.

There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to your left.

You pull a fancy looking belt out of the sack and put it on.

You watch the spiders and worgs battle it out. It does not go well for the
worgs. Finally two giant spiders remain. Now is the time to attack!

One of the spiders manages to hit before you fully get into ready position and
does a massive 7 points of damage. You return the favor by striking multiple
times against both creatures while dodging and weaving multiple attacks. -6, -2,
-1, -1, -7. One of the spiders collapses to the floor. Only one spider left. You
continue to evade attacks while dealing damage. You deal 6 points in a flurry of
strikes before the spider gets past your defenses and strikes you with a
forelimb for 1 point of damage.

FATE - 1. NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

; Magical Scythe Blades appear then vanish. 4d10 dmg. (16)

You hear a click from the floor and suddenly see the flash of silvery metal as
ghostly scythe blades appear sweeping back and forth before vanishing into
nothingness.

!dmg= 17 # @dmg: roll("4d10")
!room.npc("#6").hp= -16 # @room.npc("#6").hp: room.npc("#6").hp - dmg

The last spider bursts splashing ichor everywhere. Its pieces fall unmoving to
the floor.

You are gravely wounded and take a moment to cast Healing Hand.

;;; !Macro.heal()

!cast= False # @cast: 'succeeded' in str(player.cast('Healing Hand')).lower()
!player.mana= 2 # @player.mana: player.mana
!hp= 0 # @hp: roll('1d6') if cast else 0

;;; !Macro.heal()

!player.mana= 0 # @player.mana: player.mana
!hp= 6 # @hp: roll('1d6') if cast else 0
!player.hp= 15 # @player.hp: player.hp + hp

It takes three casts and the exhaustion of your mana, but you heal yourself
back to full strenth.

Searching about, you find nothing else of interest.

to see if anything you found is of real value.

You lay into the undead horde hacking and slashing everywhere you can to end
the threat. You quickly vanquish two of the three skeletons and then start into
the zombies. After much hacking one of the zombies drops allowing you to get
another strike into the last skeleton. As you do so, one of the zombies manages
to reach in with its clawed hands piercing your armor. -2 HP. You continue
waving your axe about in a frantic way and shortly two more zombies drop to the
floor unmoving. Another of the zombies gets past your defense and pierces your
armor. -4 HP. You finish off the remaining undead with two strikes against the
last zombie and one final hit against the last skeleton.

Looking about you see three dead skeleton warriors and four dead zombies.

You are badly injured.

Quickly searching the bodies and alcoves you find a tin of salve in one of the
zombie pockets. Opening it up and looking inside you see what looks like 3 doses
left of what might be a healing salve.

You take a dose of the salve and apply it to your wounds. You feel a warm
tingling sensation.

!hp= 11 # @hp: roll("2d8+2")
!player.hp= 16 # @player.hp: player.hp + hp

You watch in amazement as your wounds all close up and disappear. You have been
restored to full health.

You quickly pocket the remaining salve in your front right pocket for use
later.

You walk over to the empty alcove and discover a cleverly disguised door
leading elsewhere.

Deciding you've had enough danger, you go down 100ft and climb the stairs back
to the ruins of the abbey on the hill.

You return to town and take a night to rest and heal.

In the morning you go visiting merchents to see if you found anything of real
value.

away beneath the ruins!

You continue following the passage for about 70 ft and step through an opening
onto the hillside. Above you see the ruins of the abbey.

You head back to town and take time to head and relax.

The next day you visit various merchents to see if you found anything of value.

You go down 100ft and come to a bend in the passage leading to the stairwell.
Heding up the stairwell, you exit the complex into the ruins of the abbey then
pick way down hill and head back to town.

You have good night of rest and healing.

The next day you visit various merchents see what things of value you have
found.

You rush in to do battle.

You are bit by a zombie. -2 HP. You strike down a zombie. -8 HP. You leave a
long gash in another. -6 HP. One of the skeletons gets past your defense and
stabs you. -5 HP. You strike the two remaing zombies again. -4 HP. -3 HP. One of
them successfully retaliates for a clawed hand strike. -3 HP.

Girding your self as you weaken you continue dealing blow after blow. You drop
two more zombies. -4 HP. -1 HP. -1 HP.

Swinging your axe around you deal fatal damage to one of the skeleton warriors.
-9 HP. On your return swing you hit another zombie causing it to fall. -1 HP.

Only the one skeleton left.

You quickly dispatch it with two well placed strikes. -5 HP. -4 HP.

Taking stock, you realize that you are now gravely wounded.

You look the axe over:

!player.weapon.description # 
;## Axe (Dark Enchanted) (+1/+1). Two-handed.

;## The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting edges.
;## The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark blood red arcane symbols.
;## The top of the hand grip has a circle of dark blood red leather as does the bottom of the hand grip.
;## From the edge of the hasp dangles a dark blood red leather strip loop.
;## Attack Bonus: +1, Damage Bonus: +1, Grants dark sight 60ft.
;## The blade edges become wreathed in flame when attacking. The +1 effects are from the flames. 
;## 
The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting
edges. The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark
blood red arcane symbols. The top of the hand grip has a circle of dark blood
red leather as does the bottom of the hand grip. From the edge of the hasp
dangles a dark blood red leather strip loop.

Looking about the room for anything else of interest you realize the torch as
sputter out but that you can see better than before. Ah! The axe grants
darkvision! Fantastic!

Looking about there is nothing else other than the bodies of the undead and the
stone plynth.

You rush in hacking and slashing. The first lizard falls with a single hit. -9
HP. You start laying into the rest of the beasts while dodging claw and mouth.
-4 HP. -8 HP. -1 HP and another lizard drops. -6 HP. One of the remaining
lizards gets a claw swipe through your defense. -2 HP. You finish off the last
two beasts. -5 HP. -3 HP.

After defeating the lizards you take time to heal yourself up before
continuing.

Casting Healing Hand once, you are restored to full strenth.

Searching about, you find nothing else of interest.

You grope around in the pond feeling along its rough bottom. When you reach the
center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth. Feeling around a
little more you find an edge you can probably pull up on.

Pulling up on the edge of what you can now tell is some sort of metal plate you
grope around under it and find a medium sack.

Emptying the sack out you find a ring and a set of gauntlets. The ring has a
picture of a shield engraved on its inner ring. The guantlets are nicely
decorated and each one has an engraving of a fist.

You suddenly hear hissing coming from the doorway out of the cave. Looking over
quickly you see a giant spider approaching.

You walk for 60ft and come to an opening into a large cave. From here you see
small pond in the middle of the cave with a rivulet leading to your left where
it disappears into a very large crack in the wall.

You see one of the skeletons strike chipping bone off the other. The second

You pull up on the ledge and fish a metal plate out of the water. Feeling

As you start sneaking past the spiders you notice figures walking into the room
from the entranceway. You see three skeleton warriors enter the room. The
spiders take no heed of these intruders and turn their attention back on you.
This isn't good, you are trapped between the two groups, and they both seem only
interested in you.

Using your massive attack talent, you hit the first skeleton and its head goes
flying across the room. You strike the last skeleton and manage to break its
spine. It drops.

Now that everything here is dead, you open the sack and pull out a tin of what
looks like ointment or salve. A healing salve? Looks like a bit over half has
been used already.

You put the tin in your front left pocket. Who knows, maybe it will become
handy.

You see nothing else of interest here.

You are at a three way intersection with openings to straight ahead and to your
left. The passageway left disappears into darkness. The passageway straight
ahead goes for 10ft past the intersection and ends at a set of stairs heading
down.

A giant spider suddenly lumbers up out of the stair well and rushes towards
you.

You come to a small closed portcullis. Beyond it you see alcoves in the walls
everywhere you can see.

You push up on the portcullis. It gives way grudgingly with a loud screech. It
must not have been opended for a long time. It suddenly moves upwards and stops
with a bang.

You step into the room and notice that there is movement in several of the
alcoves!

With mounting horror you realize you've entered a crypt and it seems to be full
of the undead! If you turn to flee you know they will quickly catch up and
overwhelm you. Better to stand and fight at the entrace. Keep how many can
attack you at once down to one at a time.

The undead in their mad rush forwards to get at you trip up on each other
collapsing to the floor in a writhing heap.

While they are indesposed, you try and get the portcullis to close. It refuses
to budge. They quickly recover and you run out of time to keep yanking at it.

You stand valiantly against the onslaught, dealing out damage left and right in
a whirlwind of axe strikes.

Using your massive attack talent, you strike the first skeleton for 9 points
flinging it back against the wall where it collapses into a disjoint pile of
bones and rusty armor.

You swipe the first zombie twice, cutting deeply into its chest. I crumples
into a heap on the floor.

The remaining zombies crowd in a against you, you manage to strike into the
mass of stinking flesh and deal 6 points of damage against the first zombie, 2
points of damage against another another with a double strike, and 11 points
against the third.

The first zombie rakes its clawed hands across your chest getting past your
armor and dealing 2 points of damage.

You strike back it at for 1 point of damage and follow through with a
successful strike against another of the things. It drops.

Two zombies and one skeleton warrior to go!

One of the zombies reaches in and manages to bite you with its stinking maw for
8 points of damage. Ouch, that hurt!

While strike it for 2 points of damage in retaliation the skeletons finally
reach you and stab in with their rusty short swords piercing you armor and
striking you down.

Each of the spiders in turn snatch up a rat and bite down hard with their
fangs. The rats briefly squeal and thrash then become still. The spiders being
dragging their prizes in your direction up the tunnel!

You realize this is your opportunity to get past the monstrous beasts and back
into the main cave area without fighting a very one sided battle.

You edge around the spiders, which take no notice of you, being fully occupied
with their prize dinners, and return to the cave with the pond.

Opening the sack up you find a black felt bag. Examining it closely you see
that it is finely made. You've seen bags similar to this in magic shops, their
insides are bigger than their outsides.

You put the bag on your belt. It will work better than the backpack for
stashing loot.

Looking about you see nothing else of interest.

You strike one of the two remaining zombies for a whopping 10 points of damage!
Woohoo!

The skeleton archers seem to have run out of arrows. They are rushing in
brandishing their bows like clubs.

The floor suddenly gives way beneath the remaining undead revealing a 10 ft
deep pit filled with spikes!

They are skewered by the sharp tips and cease their attempts to murder you.

Setting the torch aside on the plynth you pick up the battle axe from where it
sits. Suddenly everything around seems to grow brighter. You can now see into
the shadows cast by the torch. Excellent! This axe grants darkvision!

You perform a majestic three strike combo hitting the zombie, a skeleton, and a
rat all in quick succession. Unfortunately for you the zombie reaches in and
manages to latch on and pulls itself onto you and proceeds to starting biting.
Before you can dislodge the awful thing you feel the thrust of a sword from
behind into your back from one of the skeletons. Everything goes dark.

You have perished.

You start going from alcove to alcove check the skeletons and corpses for any
possible loot when you hear a clink from the entrance. Looking over you see a
warrior skeleton walking towards you and two shambling zombies following.
Blocked in, you have no choice but to fight it out.

Rushing forward you use your massive attack talent and destroy the skeleton in
one blow. You follow that up with two quick strikes on the first zombie,
severing its head and killing it. Swinging back around you slice a long gash
across the second zombie's chest dealing 4 points of damage.

You finish looting the alcoves and find a potion and two rings.

Examining the potion you see it has the picture of wings on it.

The first ring has depictions of snowflakes artfully engraved over its entire
circumfrence.

The second ring has a picture of a shield engraved on its inside but is
otherwise plain.

You put the potion away in your backpack.

You being to follow the passage way back to the four way when you notice a
glint from the floor. Looking down you see a ring that you didn't notice as you
entered the room. Picking it up and polishing it off some reveals a finely
crafted silver ring. It is plain except for the engraving of a shield on the
inner band. You put the ring on with your other rings. You are now wearing three
rings.

The spider lunges at you and you dodge its strike. Using your massive attack
talent you hit it for 15 points of damage following up with another quick chop
for 2 more points of damage.

The spider gets past your defenses and leaves a gash on your left forearm. You
strike back for 1 point of damage. The spider again bites into you for 1 point
of damage.

Finally you get another good swing in and kill the spider with 6 points of
damage.

You can't move.

Before you appears a two-handed axe dripping with blood and a voice booms out:

"Ah! Entertainment! Agree to do a task for me and have a chance to live. Refuse
and you most certainly will die. There is an amulet secreted away on a shadow
plane where locations from this reality show up in that reality. Retrieving this
amulet then escaping the complex will result in your life being spared. After
obtaining the amulet, take it to a place of my choosing for a reward beyond just
your life."

The axe floating before you suddenly swipes out at the undead from several feet
away. The skeletons suddenly shatter into fragments and the zombie becomes
dismembered body parts in a heap on the floor.

In the doorway you see where a giant beetle covered in gashes with ichor
leaking everywhere.

rat with a decapitation when it comes back for more, then finally break the back
of the surviving rat.

You grope around in the pond feeling along its rough bottom. When you reach the
center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth. Feeling around a
little more you find an edge you can probably pull up on.

You pull up on the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your
grasp. Feeling down where it was you find a shallow depression with a sack in
it.

Suddenly you hear several heavy thuds from behind you. Looking you see three
giant spiders between you and the exit.

you and begins stabbing repeatably into your chest with its fangs. Everything
quickly goes dark.

The spiders get their act together and get past your defense and ineffectual

The floating axe vanishes and suddenly everything is moving again!

You strike out and hit a skeleton for 7 points of damage. Another skeleton hits
you for 4 points of damage. You get four strikes in while dodging stabs and
zombie claws. One of the skeletons drops to the floor. Unfortunately, the zombie
gets past your defense and sinks its teeth into your neck.

You have become a zombie.

injecting you with venom leaving gaping wounds behind each attack.

You perish.

You rush forwards hoping to squash the spider in one massive blow! You strike,
and with a horrible crack, a seam opens up in the beasts carapace. It retaliates
by grabbing and holding you in place as it injects you with more than enough
venom to kill you. As things beging fading to black, you see two more giant
spiders coming up the stairs.

You are spider fodder.

You start searching the room to see if any loot might be found in or under the

and four giant rats rush out to attack.

The battle is on!

The third giant rat attacking hits you for 1 point damage. You strike back
hitting the 2nd and 4th rats, each for 8 points of damage. You swing back around
and strike the 4th rat for 4 points of damage, killing it.

The third rat scratches you for a single point of damage. You strike the first
rat with two quick axe chops for 8 and 4 points of damage. It drops dead.

The third rat gets a bite in. In retaliation you strike it twice, one for 2
points of damage, and a second time for 10 points of damage. It expires.

You take a final swing hitting the last giant rat for 4 points of damage ending
it.

!loot_item =  Item(item, location)
!loot_item # Goggles of Night (darkvision 60ft) (#2) <loc:3>

After digging around you find a pair of goggles.

Examining them closely you notice that when looking through the lenses, all the
darkness cast by the torch light disappears allowing you to see clearly.

You rush in to attack. The undead take whacks at you before you can land any
hits, but only one manages a lucky strike. A skeleton warrior hits you for 4
points of damage. Using your massive attack talent you strike a skeleton lopping
its head off. It collapses. You strike the next two skeletons gradually wearing
them down. Then the zombie gets into range and you whack it, leaving a gash
across its chest. Two of the skeletons work their way in front of the zombie,
but miss with their jabs. You lash out twice, doing some serious damage to the
first one and ending the animation of the second one. This leaves an opening for
the zombie which attacks again, but you fend off its claws easily. You strike it
down and put a final hit into the last warrior skeleton.

You walk over and pick up the axe, setting the torch to one side on the plynth,
and heft it. It has a very nice feel and seems to thrum slightly.

You realize that you aren't seeing the room in dark shadows anymore. Yes! The
axe grants magical sight!

You stow your old axe and equip the new two handed beast.

You search the rest of the room but find nothing of interest.

FATE - 1. FATE POINTS REMAINING: 1

As you attempt to slide past the hungry creature it leaps at you definitely
intending to skewer you with its fangs, but several rocks shift under its weight
as it pounces causing it to miss you entirely. You make it back out into the
cave.

You can hear the spider hissing and spitting behind you as it gives chase. You
rush out out of the cave and down the long passageway and come to the four way
intersection.

You head down the long passage heading toward the stairs which go back up to
the surface. You stop and listen carefully. You don't hear any sign of pursuit.

As you rush down the passage fleeing the monstrous spider you spy a small
ointment can in the passage up a head. You snatch it up and pocket it as you run
by. The sound of pursuit still follows.

You rush down the stairs and enter a 90ft x 40ft room. You see casks and cask
pieces against the far wall. You hear the spider following along behind you.

Suddenly a giant rat busts out of the casks to your left and 3 skeleton
warriors raise up off the floor to your right!

You are boxed in good!

FATE - 1. NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

You see the spider crawl in going down the stairs when it knocks a small pebble
skittering down the steps. This immediately attracts the attention of the rat
which attacks. Good, maybe they'll kill each other while you try and finish off
the skeletons.

;;; !rat.run_combat4([spider1])

; Giant Spider (2) hits for 9 points and kills Giant Rat (35)

;PC party perished

;Giant Spider (2) hit points = 24

;Giant Rat (35) hit points = 0

The spider does not give the rat a chance to strike, quickly sinking its fangs
into the rat's side. The spider picks up the corpse of the rat and proceeds
heading back up stairs.

;;; !player.run_combat4([skel1, skel2, skel3])

;Skeleton Warrior (33) hit points = 9

;Player hit points = 0

The skeletons approach and before you know it you are in combat with the
undead. Each skeleton takes turns swinging at you. You fail to dodge two of
their strikes.

You have perished.

You rush down the passageway to your left and come to a portcullis. You pull it
open with a horrible screeching noise then slam it back closed behind you as you
enter the room. Quickly examining the portcullis you don't see any way to bar it
closed so you duck to one side out of sight of the passageway. Listening
carefully you don't hear any sounds of pursuit. You've escaped.

First you look at the boots. They are finely made and covered with a soft black
felt. The soles seem like they would make walking and running quieter.

The gauntlets are a bronze with pictures of a person's bicep with lightning
bolts leaping out. They have an extra special thrum about them.

You heft the axe. A one handed weapon it looks expertly made with a very
serious looking edge. It seems extra special.

would just waste magic right now.

You enter the room and begin examining the walls and floor. You notice large
dark droppings and notice an ammonia type smell in the air.

Suddenly two giant rats leap up from behind the casks and attack you.

Giant rats? Easy peasy! You use your massive attack talent and smear the first
rat all over the walls with a single strike. With two quick chops you end the
second giant rat. And not a scratch on you!

!room.notes="2 dead rats. 1 smeared against wall. looted."

You examine the walls and casks finding nothing of interest.

You head back up the stairs to the three way intersection.

You see tunnels heading straight ahead and to your right. Both disappear off
into darkness.

As you walk over to an alcove to being the grisly work of grave-robbing you
catch movement out of the corner of your eye. Quickly glancing back you see five
undead coming out of several of the other alcoves. One skeleton and four
zombies.

Using your massive attack talent you strike out and hit a zombie for 10 points
of damage leaving a wide open gash across its chest. Another zombie gets past
your defense and rakes its clawed hands across one of your arms for 1 point of
damage. You return blows and hit two zombies for 3 points each of damage, then
strike a third decapitating it. It falls. One of zombies rakes it claws past
your defense and cause 1 point of damage to your left leg. You hear a buzzing
noise. You retaliate hitting it for 3 points of damage. Another zombie manages
to get its maw in to bite you across the left arm for 4 points of damage.
Everything is suddenly cast in a greenish hue as you hear a voice from above
saying, "Throw it into the portal you fool!" Your return attacks opens the chest
of one zombie which collapses to the floor and leaves a 2 point gash in another.
You hear a snap, the green hue vanishes, and you see a small crackling ball of
lightning fall and hit one of the zombies. It explodes scattering gore
everywhere.

Taking stock of the situtation, you decide healing yourself would be the best
first thing to do.

health.

magic wand. As your hands are full, you fasten it to your belt.

way. One of the spiders bites the other one instead of you.

Regardless of their bumbling, they get their act together and get past your
defense and ineffectual strikes sinking their fangs into you over and over.

You are spider fodder.

You discover the empty alcove is actually a cleverly disguised door!

Opening it up and stepping in you find your self in a 40ft x 30ft room. All the
walls are covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far E
wall you see a mummified corpse that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X.
There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to the NE.

Walking over to the chest you find it is empty except for a lone potion vial.
Looking at it closely you see a picture of angelic wings engraved into the
glass.

Stashing the potion in your backpack, your search of the rest of the room
reveals nothing of interest.

The skeletons take swings at you but you dock, dodge, and weave through their
sword strikes dealing damage as you go. You strike the first skeleton with your
massive attack skill across its skull which shatters. You strike the second
skeleton with to hacking slashes and deal 7 points of damage. The second
skeleton strikes back and hits you for 1 point of damage. You swing your axe
around and hit the third skeleton for 1 point of damage. The second skeleton
makes another successful strike and hits you for 1 point of damage. Swinging
your axe back around in a wide arc you shatter the skulls of the two remaining
skeletons.

HIT POINTS REMAINING: 9

You walk over, pickup, and examine the axe.

The blades are a solid black with red etchings following along their cutting
edges. The hand grip is wrapped in a black leather that is stamped with dark
blood red arcane symbols. The top of the handgrap has a circle of dark blood red
leather as does the bottom of the handgrip. From the edge of the hasp dangles a
dark blood red leather strip loop.

You feel a sense of malice eminating off of the axe, though it doesn't seem
directed at you.

Carefully setting your torch down on the plynth so not as to let it go out, you
heft the two-handed battle axe and test its weight and balance.

You suddenly notice something odd. All the shadows in the room seem to have
receded away from you. As you look about you see that the torch is still casting
shadows, but you can now see into them.

As a test you extinguish the torch and realize you can still see perfectly
fine! Setting the axe down on the plynth, you wait to see how long the effect
lasts. While there is a noticible immediate darkening of the room, the ability
seems to last quite a while. This seems handy, no torch required! You decide to
pick the axe back up and use it.

You rush back to the 3 way intersection but find your way blocked by two
zombies part way down the passage! You have no choice but to fight.

The zombies lash out trying to grapple you with their clawed hands so they can
pull you close and start munching. You aren't having any of that! You hack the
first zombie three times and watch it fall then immediately wail on the second
zombie with multiple axe slashes till it too also falls. Quickly searching the
corpses you find nothing of value.

manages to bite for 4 points of damage. You kill the third rat with a single
blow. Swinging back around you chop the second rat two more times before it
collapses, dead.

Taking advantage of the rats feasting on the zombies you wade in hacking and
slashing with your axe. It turns into a slug fest as you hack and hack and hack.
Finally, the last rodent lies twitching on the floor. And not a scratch!

You search through the caskets hoping for loot. Digging around in the detritus,
you find a plain banded ring with the picture of a boot on its inside band.

You enter a very large crack in the cave wall and go about 30 ft and notice the
ground starting to slope upwards. You hear hissing from behind. Turning you see
two giant spiders rushing in to attack.

As the spiders rush in, they tangle up in each others legs. You take the
opportunity to get in a swipe against the nearest monster!

You leave a long crack down its carapace.

strike again with impunity!

You swing out against the second spider, but don't create nearly as large a
crack.

The spiders untangle themselves and stab out you with their forelegs, the first
spider missing, but the second one piercing you twice. Darkness envelopes you.

You are spider fodder.

you get a rushing sensation like something is heading towards you at great

Using your massive attack talent, you strike the first rat for 11 points and
leave a deep gouge in its side. Your next swing damages the third rat for 6
points along its face. The first rat rakes at you with its claws for 1 point of
damage. You dodge more attacks then swing hitting the third rat for 5 points
with a follow up chop that ends its life. Unfortunately, the 2nd rat takes
advantage of your occupation with the third rat and grapples you from behind,
toppling you. You quickly succumb to the onslaught of teeth and claws.

You have perished.

between you and the exit. As you turn to face them you hear gurgling noises

skeleton warrior climbing up from where it had been laying just under the
surface of the water.

reaches out with clawed hands, but gets tangled up with the skeleton as it
prepares to jab out with its sword.

You swing your axe back around and hit the skeleton for 6 points of damage with
your massive attack skill. The zombie takes advantage of your focus on the
skeleton and tears into you with its teeth and clawed hands.

You perish.

You step into a natural cave. Water oozes down the walls and forms a 30ft
diameter pond in the middle. You notice water dripping from the cave roof about
30ft above. From the pond a rivulet of water heads into a crack to your left
which appears large enough to walk into. The pond is covered in what appears to
be a dark green scummy algae. But what captures your attention the most is the
fight happening between two hungry giant spiders and a giant beetle who appears
about to become dinner.

;;; !beetle1.run_combat4([spider1, spider2])

; NPC party has initiative

Both spiders quickly move in striking with their fangs injecting loads of venom
into the beetle. The beetle struggles to keep defending itself but quickly slows
then becomes still. As you stand there quietly, the spiders drag their dinner
into the large crack in the left wall and disappear into darkness.

; "Cast succeeded. Healing Hand: Touch. 1d6 HP healed. Mana burn raises heal by +1." # @player.cast("Healing Hand")
!player.mana= 1 # @player.mana: player.mana
!heal= 4 # @heal: roll("1d6")
!player.hp= 9 # @player.hp: player.hp + heal

; "Cast succeeded. Healing Hand: Touch. 1d6 HP healed. Mana burn raises heal by +1." # @player.cast("Healing Hand")
!player.mana= 0 # @player.mana: player.mana
!heal= 3 # @heal: roll("1d6")
!player.hp= 12 # @player.hp: player.hp + heal

It takes two casts and depletion of your mana reserves, but you are back at
full strength.

You step into the pond and grope around feeling along its rough bottom. When
you reach the center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can pull up on. You pull up on
the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. You toss
the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow depression with a
sack in it.

; "Amulet of Weakness, MAX HP -1d3" # @loot()
!max_hp_bns= -1 # @max_hp_bns: - roll("1d3")
!amulet = Item("Amulet of Weakness, Max HP: {max_hp_bns,+}", location)
!amulet # Amulet of Weakness, Max HP: {max_hp_bns,+} (#1) <loc:4-pond>

From within the sack you pull out a small amulet on a silver chain. Engraved on
it you see the picture of a human heart.

You follow the passage for 50ft and come to a cave with a tiled floor. You see
a stone plynth on the far side holding a two handed war axe. Even from this
distance you can tell that it is a finely crafted weapon. Next to the plynth on
the floor you see the remains of a monk with several arrows in its back. It
looks like the monk was trying to reach the axe before being struck down. As you
look beyond the dead monk you see figures moving into the torchlight and hear
the spider coming up from behind.

You realize this is not a good situtation as the figures resolve to be 3
skeleton warriors and a zombie. The only thing left to do is fight and hope!

FATE - 1. NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

Looking up, you see the spider crawling across the ceiling preparing to land on
you when suddenly a section of roof gives way and it falls. Much to your horror,
you see it crash into two other giant spiders that were crawling down the
passage after you!

!dmg= 1 # @dmg: roll("1d6x")
!spider1.hp -= dmg

Unfortunately it does not look like the fall did it or its friends any harm.

They swarm over you and quickly take your life.

You have perished.

You come back to the portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves
in the walls. You can't see into the alcoves from here. You push the portcullis
open with the sound of rusted screeching metal and step into the room. You can
now see into the alcoves and notice they are filled with the skeletons and
corpses of monks, except one. Which is in the right wall in the near corner.

Examining the empty alcove you see it is actually a cleverly disguised door
leading to another area!

!location # 5
!location= "5a"

!room # 
;## ROOM: 5a (1)

;## and bloody looking acts. On the far E wall you see a mummified corpse
;## that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X. There is a small open
;## chest in the far corner of the room to the NE.

Opening the door and entering, you see a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are
covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far wall you see
a mummmified corpose that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X.

There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to your left.

; Keoghtaz's Ointment, doses: 1d4+1, damages 2d8+2
; Ring of Protection, BASE ARMOR +1
; Wand of Magic Missiles, 1d3 uses/day

Finally! Loot!

You walk over and examine the items in the chest.

!doses= 2 # @doses: roll("1d4+1")
!tin = Item(f"Keoghtaz's Ointment, doses: {doses}, damages 2d8+2", "5a")

!uses= 1 # @uses: roll("1d3")
!wand = Item(f"Wand of Magic Missiles, {uses} uses/day", "5a")

You find a tin, a ring, and a wand.

Opening the tin you see a salve, partly used. A healing ointment maybe?

The ring is a plain silver band with a picture of a shield on the inner band.

The wand looks like willow wood and has a single glowing sliver of a blue gem
at its base.

As you prepare to slide the ring on you hear a lot of racket coming from the

Looking up you see multiple skeletons and zombies entering the room!

The zombies return your attack but their attacks tangle with each other and
they don't make contact.

You again strike out hitting two of the zombies for a total of 12 points of

showing rotting teeth ready to chown down on your flesh when a skeleton's sword
pierces it through the chest throwing its attack way off.

Taking advantage of their confused attack, you strike the skeleton warrior,
crushing its chest, sending it toppling backwards into a heap. You hit the
zombie that was stabbed by the skeleton and it falls unmoving. You start hacking
and slashing into the remaining zombies and skeleton and chop them into heaps on
the floor.

Three zombies and two skeletons lie on the floor in various states of severe
damage.

You attack the spider while it is distracted. You swing wildly at it and miss
horribly bad as it leaps to one side and stabs at you with its forelegs.
Unfortunately for you, both strikes pierce your armor and go deep into your
chest.

You are spider fodder.

ground starting to slope upwards.

Suddenly a giant spider rushes you from ahead.

; NPC party has initiative
; Player hits Giant Spider (#20) for 11 points of damage

A mighty struggle ensues between you and hungry monster. The spider leaps at
you and you dodge. You quickly hammer in two axe chops for 11 points and 4
points of damage. The spider retaliates striking you with one of its legs for 2
points of damage. Again you strike two times for a total of 8 points of damage.
The spider looks weakened, but it still has fight as it slashes at you again
with a leg and causes another 2 points of damage. With a final swing of the axe,
you terminate the beast.

!room.notes="1 dead spider"

You continue following the passage and come to an opening to the outside. You
have found another way in and out of the complex.

You still have loot to seek.

You head back to the four way intersection.

You are in the cave with pond in the middle. There is a large crack in wall to
your left.

; (False, '') # @wander()

Peering inside the cave you see nothing moving, so you proceed to search the
pond.

Feeling around in the pond you come to a smooth spot with an edge, like a
board. You pull up on the edge and fish out a metal plate. Feeling around where
the plate was you find a depression with a sack.

You pull the sack free, step out of the pond, and dump its contents onto the
floor for perusal.

!loot_qty= 1 # @loot_qty: roll("1d2")
; "Potion of Invisibility" # @loot()

The only thing that falls out besides a little mud is a potion vial. Examining
it you see that there is a picture of a closed on on the vial. You stash it in
your backpack.

!player.equipment.append(Item("Potion of Invisibility", "backpack"))

Further searching reveals nothing of interest.

face you, two skeleton warriors and three zombies step out from the alcoves and
face you.

You stand in the doorway to keep them fighting you one at a time.

The zombies reach you first. Using your massive attack talent, you decapitate
the first zombie. The second zombie rakes its clawed hands at your armor,
getting through in one spot for 3 points of damage. You strike it back, hacking
deeply into its chest for 5 points of damage. It returns the favor and rakes you
for another 5 points of damage. You strike it once more, but only cause 1 point
of damage. It grabs you, pulls you close, and clamps its teeth about your neck.
Blood splashes everywhere as your life drains away.

You have perished and become a zombie.

it issues. Three more strikes with your axe and the beetle dies.

You come to an open portcullis. Beyond you see a 90ft x 40ft room with alcoves
in the walls. You can see the alcoves are filled with the skeletons and corpses
of monks.

In the middle of the room, rushing towards you, is a very familiar looking
giant spider!

Unfortunately, the spider obliterates the undead with its forelegs. In a blur
of motion you see if strike out shattering the skeletons one after the other
then it finally impales the zombie and flings it away.

Not a scratch! Not one of the undead did any damage to the monster!

It turns its attention back upon you. It looks annoyed.

you reach the center you notice the texture suddenly becomes very smooth.
Feeling around a little more you find an edge you can pull up on. You pull up on
the edge and a large metal plate comes to the surface in your grasp. You toss
the plate aside and feel down where it was. You find a shallow depression with a

Dumping the sack out you find a potion. There is the picture of a dotted
outline of a person on the vial. No telling what it does. You stow the vial to
sell later.

Opening the sack and reaching inside, you come out with a headband which you
quickly put on.

You feel your mana pool surge, too bad that won't help with hand-to-hand
combat.

The spiders leap at you and freeze in mid-air. You can't move.

Before you appears a two-handed axe dripping with blood and a voice booms out:

"Ah! Entertainment! Agree to do a task for me and have a chance to live. Refuse
and you most certainly will die. There is an amulet secreted away on a shadow
plane where locations from this reality show up in that reality. Retrieving this
amulet then escaping the complex will result in your life being spared. After
obtaining the amulet, take it to a place of my choosing for a reward beyond just
your life."

You enter a very large crack in the cave wall and go about 30 ft and notice the

from behind. Waving you torch about you see two giant spiders come into view
from in front of you and one giant spider come into view behind you. You are
trapped!

loads of venom.

You enter a very large crack in the cave wall and go about 30 ft and notice the
ground starting to slope upwards.

You hear a horrible hissing from behind. Turning you see a giant spider
approaching.

The giant spider leaps at you but misses widely as some stones shift under its
feet.

;Player hit points = 11

Taking advantage of its bad luck, you use your massive attack talent and strike
down with your axe cracking its carapace open in a long oozing crack for 16
points of damage. You quickly hack and hack and hack the stunned creature for 3
points, another 3 points, and then finally 2 points of damage, killing it.

!room.notes="dead spider. long crack on carapace."

Search about you find nothing of interest.

You continue following the passage and come to an opening leading outside. You
have discovered another way into and out of the complex.

You have more loot to collect and head back down the tunnel back to the cave.

Examining the empty alcove you see it is actually a cleverly disguised door
leading to another area!

Opening the door you step inside to a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are
covered with depictions of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far wall you see
a mummmified corpose that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X.

There is a small open chest in the far corner of the room to your left.

ground starting to slope upwards.

As you continue following the passage upwards you are suddenly attacked by two
giant spiders lunging at you from the darkness ahead.

The two spiders close in and latch onto you with their forelegs. Each sinks its
fangs into you injecting venom. Everything goes dark.

You are spider fodder.

You have entered a 40ft x 30ft room. All the walls are covered with depictions
of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far wall you see a mummmified corpose
that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X. There is a small open chest in the
far corner of the room to your left.

You proceed to search for useful items. You examine the corpse on the X cross,
but find nothing.

You then go over to the open chest and peer inside. You find a pair of boots.
Two pairs of gauntlets. And a set of goggles.

You see a nicely made pair of black felt boots with a soft sole that looks like
it was made for being quiet. You also see two sets of gauntlets, the first set
has a picture of a man's bicep with lightning bolts around. The second set has
the picture of a large upraised fist. The goggles reveal themselves to provide
vision in the dark when you look through the lenses.

Swinging the monstrous axe, you strike each skeleton in turn, shattering them
one by one. With two whacks, you gut the zombie and it falls.

As you look about after the battle, you realize you can see in the shadows as
clearly as in the torchlight. The axe grants darkvision! Wow! This weapon is
amazing! As you retrieve your one handed axe to put it into your backpack, you
find a headband on the plynth as well. It is made of soft black felt with red
trim.

Walking over you set the torch down on the plynth and pick up the two-handed

weapon decide what to do next.

busted open. You don't see any doors or passages in the room.

to attack you!

The third and fourth rats attack the second rat from two different sides at
once. It doesn't last long under the onslaught. They turn to look at you with
blood dripping from their maws. These are some mean looking rats!

;Player hit points = 0

The rats engage. Using your massive attack talent you deal the fourth rat 10
points of damage. It retaliates with a bite taking 2 points of your health. You
hack at it again and it drops to the floor twitching. The third rat takes
advantage of your distraction with the fourth rat and neatly severes you head
from you body in a single bite.

You have perished.

You return to the room of corpse filled alcoves. In the room on the floor is a
skeleton and two corpses.

A glint of something catches your eye on one of the corpses. Walking over, you
discover a tin of ointment in a pocket of the shredded remains of pants on the
corpse.

It looks like it could be a healing ointment.

You stash it in your front right pocket.

The axe floating before you suddenly swipes out at the rats from several feet
away. They suddenly have deep gashes all over their forms. A deep red blood
spouts out in all directions. They collapse unmoving to the floor. In pieces.

You put the goggles on and realize you can see into every shadow in the room
cast by the torch light. Great! This grants darkvision! You extinguish your
torch, freeing up a hand.

Searching about the room, you find nothing else of interest.

You carefully look over the alcoves. You see a mixture of monk warrior
skeletons and monk corpes in all the alcoves but one. In the right wall you see
one alcove that is empty. Walking over to the empty alcove you see it is
actually a cleverly disguised door leading to another area!

You are at the entrance to a 40ft by 30ft room. All the walls are covered with
depictions of evil and bloody looking acts. On the far wall you see a mummified
corpse that is tied with barbed wire to a wooden X. There is a small open chest
in the far corner of the room to the left.

You enter the room and immediately notice that except for the cross with the
mummified corpse that the only other item of interest is the open chest. Walking
over to it you see three items inside.

Feeling weak, you realize your health is low and cast healing hand exhausting
your mana.

You hear moaning coming from the entrance. Looking up from where you were
preparing to go through the gear, you see two zombies approaching.

The zombies attack with surprising ferocity. You dodge their initial strikes,
and you manage to hack the first zombie's head mostly off in a single swing, but
it keeps attacking. It manages to scratch you for 1 point of damage. In
retaliation you hack at the zombies repeatably until they both drop. It takes
four hits to take out the second zombie. But only two for the first.

You start examining the gear, picking each item up each in turn carefully and
considering it.

!list_items(locals()) # 
;##  boots: Boots of Striding and Springing, +2 (#1)
;##  gloves: Gloves of Swimming and Climbing (#1)
;##  ring: Ring of Slowness, Rogue -1 (#1)

You pick up the boots. Covered in a black soft felt material they seem superbly
made and expensive.

Turning the gloves over in your hand, you notice they are webbed between the
fingures and have tiny bowl like indentations on the fingure tips.

The ring is flat black color, making it look ideal for something for sneaking
around if it has magic. Looking inside the inner band on the ring, you see a
pair of shoes with wings on them.

Taking the initative and striking while the zombie tries to unimpale itself
from the skeletons sword, you strike the skeleton, crushing its chest, then
decapitate the zombie. With a final swish of your axe you also decapitate the
skeleton warrior.

Quickly searching through the alcoves you find nothing of value.

You continue down the passageway heading back to the 4-way intersection.

You pick the amulet up and examine it closely. It is bronze in color, feels
warm to the touch, and has engravings of individual fists on both sides. It
feels like you should put it on.

You pick up the armor and examine it closely. It appears to be expertly crafted
scale mail. Definitely looks better than one you normally find available for
sale with merchents.

The bag is made of a expensive fine black velvet with a black leather
drawstring. You hear clinking when you pick it up.

You pick up the gauntlets and look over them carefully. They are bronze in
color with decorative swirls surrounding various engravings of fists and large
firm biceps. It feels like you should equip this gear.

You pick up the ring. It is a simple band with a tourmaline set into it. You
notice faint engravings of snowflakes on the inner band.

You pick up the wand and examine it closely. It looks to be made of willow
tree. Near its base you see 4 tiny blue gem stone slivers. One of them appears
dark. The other three glow with a faint inner light.

You pick up the mace and examine it. About 2ft long, it is made of steel and
ends in a spiked head. It is plain looking not having any decorations.

You start searching the alcoves for loot when you hear a moan and clanking
noises from the entrance.

Turning you see a skeleton warrior and three zombies rushing towards you.

As they rush you a zombie gets in the way of a sword thrust from the zombie and
takes a strike in the back.

As the skeleton is pulling its sword out of the first zombie, the remaining
zombies attack from all sides. You are not able to defense yourself against the
onslaught.

You are a zombie.

NO FATE POINTS REMAINING.

You wake up on the top of a barren hill. You see a two-handed black axe, a set
of black chain mail armor, and a flight of stairs heading down into the ground.

Looking about you see a purple sky filled with green stars. There are
occasional forks of lightning off in the distance and orange flashes on the
horizon in all directions. Looking down from the barren hilltop you see that
everything past the base of the hill is shrouded is a deep gloom with some sort
of sea composed of roiling black fog all around. You get the feeling if you walk
down into the black fog, you would not come back out.

You realize that all of your stuff is gone. You only have what clothes you are
wearing!

You hear squeaking noises coming from the stairwell.
