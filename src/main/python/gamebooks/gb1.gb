Atop of the hill stand the ruins of what was once an abbey. Legend has it that
long ago the studious monks became corrupted by some evil and were destroyed by
a band of wizards.

As a new adventurer you have come seeking loot. Hopefully stuff that will help
with future adventures, or at least enough money to get a meal and room at a
decent inn.

You walk up the hill to the ruins.

Digging through the rumble you happen upon a flight of stairs leading down
underground.

You walk down a flight of stairs and come to a short 10ft passageway which ends
at a wall with an opening to another flight of stairs heading down into
darkness.

You light a torch and enter the passageway turning to the right and follow the
stairs down a landing which leads straight ahead to another set of stairs going
down. You follow those stairs down and walk through a short passageway that
makes a right turn into a much longer passageway disappearing into darkness.

You stop and listening carefully before proceeding. You only hear your own
breathing. Deciding there is nothing waiting to attack you in the darkness beyond
the reach of the torch light you continue on.

You follow the passage for 60ft and come to a four way intersection. The
passages /N/, /W/, and /S/ disappear into darkness.
