Adding a brief description of your adventure to the review would be appreciated.

My husband is also a writer, so please look for "Forgiving Judas" by Spencer Conrad.

[Go down the stairs|d70ae699]
// Start the Game|906d2fff

You walk down one flight of stairs, then another and come to a bend in passageway.

You see another flight of stairs disappearing into darkness.

:Continue Downwards|85aacc47
:Light a torch|2e3f2197

[Continue|d91ac75b]
// Start the Game|906d2fff

Atop of the hill stand the ruins of what was once an abbey.
Legend has it that long ago the studious monks became corrupted by some evil
and were destroyed by a band of wizards.

As a new adventurer you have come seeking loot. Hopefully stuff that will
help with future adventures, or at least enough money to get a meal and
room at a decent inn.

You walk up the hill to the ruins.

Digging through the rumble you happen upon a flight of stairs leading down underground.

:Go down the stairs|d70ae699

[Continue Downwards|85aacc47]
// Go down the stairs|d70ae699

!1d6 = 1

As you step into the bend in the passage, you feel a click, and hear a snap from beneath your feet.

The floor disappears out from under you and you fall.

!2d10 = 16

You crash into a bed of spikes.

Fate saves you from a gruesome death!
Miracously you land between all the spikes!

FATE - 1. FATE REMAINING: 1.

Next to you lies the pierced remains of a previous adventurer who was not so lucky.

:Loot the Body|e5886c24

[Light a torch|2e3f2197]
// Go down the stairs|d70ae699

[Loot the Body|e5886c24]
// Continue Downwards|85aacc47

You dig through the belongings of the corpse to see what you can find.

You find:

* Spellbook
* Torches: 1
* Lock Pick
* Rope: 10 yards
* Tore up clothing

Upon examining the spellbook you find one spell:

* Food and Water, Mana: 2, Difficulty: Routine, 1 Daily ration of food and water.

Discarding the clothing, you place everything else into your backpack.

:Climb out of the Pit|4f35e379

[Climb out of the Pit|b84febcf]
// Continue Downwards|85aacc47

[Climb out of the Pit|4f35e379]
// Loot the Body|e5886c24

To see the sides of the pit better you light a torch.

TORCHES - 1, TORCHES REMAINING: 3

After carefully examining the sides of the pit in the torch light
you discover a set of handholds that allow you to climb out to the
top of the next flight of stairs heading down.

You go down the stairs and follow a passage 3 meters before it comes to
a bend turning to your right.

!1d6 = 5 // wandering monster check

You follow the passage 300 meters and come to a four way junction.

:Go right|33092c7d
:Go straight ahead|81df850c
:Go left|04ffe3bd

[Go right|33092c7d]
// Climb out of the Pit|4f35e379

!1d6 = 4 // wandering monster check

You follow the passage 210 meters and come to a rusting iron porticullis
blocking your way into the room beyond. From floor to ceiling you see a series of alcoves
covering every wall. In the alcoves rest the bones of long dead monks.

:Open the porticullis|7356d612
:Follow the passage back|4d61512b

[Go straight ahead|81df850c]
// Climb out of the Pit|4f35e379

[Go left|04ffe3bd]
// Climb out of the Pit|4f35e379

[Open the porticullis|7356d612]
// Go right|33092c7d

Putting your weight behind it, you manage to open the porticullus
with the screeching sound of long rusted metal.

!1d6 = 4 // wandering monster check

:Enter the room|cc060ada
:Follow the passage back|1603f137

[Follow the passage back|4d61512b]
// Go right|33092c7d

[Enter the room|cc060ada]
// Open the porticullis|7356d612

!1d6 = 5 // wandering monster check

You enter the room. The ceiling is 3 meters above you.

You see that the alcoves go all the way around the room.
Each alcove is about 3 meters x 3 meters in size.

:Search the alcoves|e8a86cc6
:Search the room|04da0905

[Follow the passage back|1603f137]
// Open the porticullis|7356d612

[Search the alcoves|e8a86cc6]
// Enter the room|cc060ada

!1d6 = 3 // wandering monster check

You begin rifling through the alcoves starting on your right looking for loot.

Suddenly, across the room you hear a clattering sound.

Quickly turning to take a look, you see two skeletons and two zombies standing before you
with empty alcoves behind them.

!1d4 = 2 // count of skeletons
!1d3 = 2 // count of zombies

:Flee down the passage|d390e2a8

!1d6 = 6 // wandering monster check

[Fight|c22133b7]
// Search the alcoves|e8a86cc6

You have chosen to stand your ground. How dare this undead filth attack you without warning!

!1d6 = 2 // initiative undead
!1d6 = 1 // initiative player

And they are upon you, attacking first!

!1d4 = 2 // how many?
!1d4 = 4 // which npc? 1 = skel a, 2 = skel b, 3 = zom a, 4 = zom b
!1d4 = 3 // which npc? 1 = skel a, 2 = skel b, 3 = zom a, 4 = zom b

!1d6 + 6 = 12 // attack against defense 7
!1d6 = 3 // claw and bite damage
@HP = 11
@HP_ARMOR = 10
@HP_ARMOR - 3 = 7

!1d6 + 6 = 10 // attack against defense 7
!1d6x = 2 // claw and bite damage
@HP = 11
@HP_ARMOR = 7
@HP_ARMOR - 2 = 5

A groaning zombie reaches out to you with clawed hands and gnashing teeth.
His claws leaving gouges in your armor. He is followed up by a second
zombie attacking which adds to the number of gouges in your armor.

!1d6 + 5 = 9 // axe attack against zombie 7
!1d6x = 4 // axe damage
@zombie_3.HP = 12
@zombie_3.HP_ARMOR = 0
@zombie_3.HP - 4 = 8

You swing your axe around and hit the second zombie with a mighty wet thwack sinking into the
creatures chest and pull it away with a messy sounding squelch.

!1d4 = 2 // how many?

!1d4 = 2 // which npc? 1 = skel a, 2 = skel b, 3 = zom a, 4 = zom b
!1d6 + 3 = 6 // attack against defense 7

!1d4 = 3 // which npc? 1 = skel a, 2 = skel b, 3 = zom a, 4 = zom b
!1d6 + 6 = 9 // zombie attack against defense 7
!1d6x = 5 // claw and bite damage
@HP_ARMOR = 5

A skeleton swings a short sword at you and barely misses. It is followed up by
another zombie strike which rips the ragged remains of your armor off your person.

!1d6 + 5 = 11 // axe attack against zombie 7
!1d6x = 1 // axe damage
@zombie_3.HP = 8
@zombie_3.HP_ARMOR = 0
@zombie_3.HP - 1 = 7

You attack again with your axe and only do a glancing blow against the zombie.

!1d4 = 3 // how many?
!1d4 = 3 // which npc? 1 = skel a, 2 = skel b, 3 = zom a, 4 = zom b
!1d6 + 6 = 8 // zombie attack against defense 7
!1d6x = 21 // claw and bite damage

FATE - 1. FATE REMAINING: 0.

!1d4 = 1 // which npc? 1 = skel a, 2 = skel b, 3 = zom a, 4 = zom b
!1d4 = 1 // which npc? 1 = skel a, 2 = skel b, 3 = zom a, 4 = zom b

The zombie attacking leaps forward trying to land on you. At the last moment,
a pebble under the zombie's foot causes it to completely lose its footing.
It falls prone and knocks down both skeletons as they were preparing to shove
their short swords into your chest. Only the second zombie is currently standing.

!1d6 + 5 = 6 // axe attack against zombie 7
!1d6x = 1 // axe damage
@zombie_4.HP = 12
@zombie_4.HP_ARMOR = 0
@zombie_4.HP - 1 = 11

The second zombie attacks and leaves long burning gouges across your chest.

!1d6 + 6 = 11 // zombie attack against defense 7
!1d6x = 4 // claw and bite damage

@HP - 4 = 7
